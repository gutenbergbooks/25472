<h2>Blackbeard: Buccaneer</h2>


<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THAT COURTEOUS PIRATE, CAPTAIN BONNET</h3>


<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE year of 1718 seems very dim and far away,
but the tall lad who sauntered down to the harbor
of Charles Town, South Carolina, on a fine,
bright morning, was much like the youngsters of this
generation. His clothes were quite different, it is true,
and he lived in a queer, rough world, but he detested
grammar and arithmetic and loved adventure, and would
have made a sturdy tackle for a modern high-school
football team. He wore a peaked straw hat of Indian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
weave, a linen shirt open at the throat, short breeches
with silver buckles at the knees, and a flint-lock pistol
hung from his leather belt.</div>

<p>He passed by scattered houses and stores which were
mere log huts loopholed for defense, with shutters and
doors of hewn plank heavy enough to stop a musket ball.
The unpaved lanes wandered between mud holes in
which pigs wallowed enjoyably. Negro slaves, half-naked
and bearing heavy burdens, jabbered the dialects
of the African jungle from which they had been kidnapped
a few months before. Yemassee Indians clad
in tanned deer-skins bartered with the merchants and
hid their hatred of the English. Jovial, hard-riding
gentlemen galloped in from the indigo plantations and
dismounted at the tavern to drink and gamble and fight
duels at the smallest excuse.</p>

<p>Young Jack Cockrell paid scant heed to these accustomed
sights but walked as far as the wharf built of
palmetto piling. The wide harbor and the sea that
flashed beyond the outer bar were ruffled by a piping
breeze out of the northeast. The only vessel at anchor
was a heavily sparred brig whose bulwarks were
high enough to hide the rows of cannon behind the closed
ports.</p>

<p>The lad gazed at the shapely brig with a lively curiosity,
as if here was something really interesting. Presently
a boat splashed into the water and was tied alongside
the vessel while a dozen of the crew tumbled in to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
sprawl upon the thwarts and shove the oars into the
thole-pins. An erect, graceful man in a red coat and a
great beaver hat roared a command from the stern-sheets
and the pinnace pulled in the direction of the
wharf.</p>

<p>"Pirates, to be sure!" said Jack Cockrell to himself,
without a sign of alarm. "'Tis Captain Stede Bonnet
and his <i>Royal James</i>. I know the ship. I saw her
when she came in leaking last October and was careened
on the beach at Sullivan's Island. A rich voyage this
time, for the brig rides deep."</p>

<p>The coast of South Carolina swarmed with pirates
two hundred years ago, and they cared not a rap for the
law. Indeed, some of these rascals lived on friendly
terms with the people of the small settlements and swaggered
ashore to squander the broad gold pieces and merchandise
stolen from honest trading vessels. You must
not blame the South Carolina colonists too harshly because
they sometimes welcomed the visiting pirates instead
of clapping them in jail. Charles Town was a
village at the edge of a wilderness filled with hostile Indians.
By sea it stood in fear of attack by the Spaniards
of Florida and Havana. There were almost no crops
for food and among the population were many runaways
from England, loafers and vagabonds who hated
the sight of work.</p>

<p>The pirates helped them fight their enemies and did a
thriving trade in goods that were sorely needed. Respectable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
citizens grumbled and one high official was
removed in disgrace because he encouraged the pirates
to make Charles Town their headquarters, but there was
no general outcry unless the sea-rovers happened to
molest English ships outside the harbor.</p>

<p>It was Captain Stede Bonnet himself who steered the
pinnace and cursed his sweating sailors in a deep voice
which went echoing across the bay. He made a brave
figure in his scarlet coat, with the brass guard of his
naked cutlass winking in the sun. His boat's crew had
been mustered from many climes and races, several
strapping Englishmen, a wiry, spluttering little
Frenchman, a swarthy Portuguese with gold rings in his
ears, a brace of stolid Norwegians, and two or three
coal black negroes from Barbadoes.</p>

<p>They were well armed, every weapon burnished clean
of rust and ready for instant use. Some wore tarnished,
sea-stained finery looted from hapless prizes, a brocaded
waistcoat, a pair of tasseled jack-boots, a plumed hat, a
ruffled cape. The heads of several were bound around
with knotted kerchiefs on which dark stains showed,&mdash;marks
of a brawl aboard the brig or a fight with another
ship.</p>

<p>Soon a second boat moved away from the <i>Royal
James</i> and many people drifted toward the wharf to
see the pirates come ashore, but they left plenty of room
when the captain scrambled up the weedy ladder and
told his men to follow him. Charles Town felt little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
dread of Stede Bonnet himself. He knew how to conduct
himself as a gentleman and the story was well
known,&mdash;how he had been a major in the British army
and a man of wealth and refinement. He had left his
home in Barbadoes to follow the trade of piracy because
he couldn't get along with his wife, so the rumor ran.
At any rate, he seemed oddly out of place among the
dirty rogues who sailed under the black flag.</p>

<p>He looked more the soldier than the sailor as he strode
along the wharf, his lean, dark visage both grim and
melancholy, his chin clean shaven, his mustachios carefully
cropped. There were respectful greetings from
the crowd of idlers and a gray-haired seaman all warped
with rheumatism spoke up louder than the rest.</p>

<p>"Good morrow to ye, Cap'n Bonnet! I be old Sam
Griscom that sailed bos'n with you on a marchant voyage
out of Liverpool. An' now you are a fine gentleman
of fortune, with moidores and pieces of eight to
fling at the gals, an' here I be, a sheer hulk on the
beach."</p>

<p>Captain Stede Bonnet halted, stared from beneath
heavy brows, and a smile made his seamed, sun-dried
face almost gentle as he replied:</p>

<p>"It cheers me to run athwart a true old shipmate. A
slant of ill fortune, eh, Sam Griscom? You are too old
and crippled to sail in the <i>Royal James</i>. Here, and a
blessing with the gift."</p>

<p>The pirate skipper rammed a hand in his pocket and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
flung a shower of gold coins at the derelict seaman while
the crowd cheered the generous deed. It was easy to
guess why Stede Bonnet was something of a hero in
Charles Town. He passed on and turned into the
street. Most of his ruffians were at his heels but one of
the younger of them delayed to pay his compliments to
a pretty girl whose manner was sweet and shy and gentle.
She had remained aloof from the crowd, having
some errand of her own at the wharf, and evidently
hoped to be unobserved. Jack Cockrell had failed to
notice her, absorbed as he was in gazing his fill of Captain
Stede Bonnet.</p>

<p>The girl resented the young pirate's gallantry and
would have fled, but he nimbly blocked her path. Just
then Jack Cockrell happened to glance that way and his
anger flamed hot. He was about to run after Captain
Bonnet and beg him to interfere but the maid's distress
was too urgent. Her blackguardly admirer was trying
to slip his arm around her trim waist while he laughingly
demanded a kiss from those fair lips. She evaded him
and screamed for help.</p>

<p>There were lusty townsmen among those who beheld
the scene but they sheepishly stood in their tracks and
were afraid to punish the insolent pirate with his dirk
and pistols. He was much taller and heavier than Jack
Cockrell, the lad of seventeen, who came of gentlefolk
and was unused to brawls with weapons. But the
youngster hesitated no more than an instant, although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
his own pistol lacked a flint and was carried for
show.</p>

<p>His quick eye spied a capstan bar which he snatched
up as a cudgel. Chivalry had taught him that a man
should never reckon the odds when a woman appealed
for succor. With a headlong rush he crossed the wharf
and swung the hickory bar. The pirate dodged the blow
and whipped out his dirk which slithered through Jack's
shirt and scratched his shoulder. Undismayed, he aimed
a smashing blow at the pirate's wrist and the dirk went
spinning into the water.</p>

<p>The rascal tugged at a pistol in his belt but it was
awkward work with his left hand and he was bewildered
by this amazing attack. Before he could clear for action,
Jack smote him on the pate and the battle ended
then and there, for the pirate staggered back, missed his
footing, and toppled overboard with a tremendous
splash.</p>

<p>Leaping to the edge of the wharf, Jack saw him bob
to the surface and strike out for shore. Then the
doughty young champion ran to offer his escort to the
damsel in distress. But she had hastened to slip away
from this hateful notoriety and he saw her at the bend
of the street where she turned to wave him a grateful
farewell.</p>

<p>He would have hastened to overtake her but just then
Captain Stede Bonnet came striding back in a temper
so black that it terrified his own men. His wrath was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
not aimed at Jack Cockrell, for he laid a hand upon the
lad's arm and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"A shrewd stroke, boy, and a mettlesome spirit! You
struck him swift and hard. 'Twould please me better
if you had killed the dog."</p>

<p>Stede Bonnet waited with folded arms until the culprit
had emerged from the water. Jack Cockrell had
punished him severely and there was no more fight in
him. His head was reeling, the blood ran into his eyes,
and he had swallowed much salt water. Captain Bonnet
crooked a finger at him and he obeyed without a
word. For a moment they stood face to face, the
wretched offender trembling, the captain scowling as he
said:</p>

<p>"And so you mistook a lady for a common serving
wench, Will Brant? Would ye have Charles Town rise
and reeve the ropes about our necks? Is this your promise
of good behavior? Learn a lesson then, poor fool."</p>

<p>With the steel-shod butt of a pistol Stede Bonnet hit
him squarely between the eyes. He dropped without a
groan and lay stretched out as if dead. The captain
kicked him once and carelessly shouted:</p>

<p>"Ho, men! Toss this squire o' dames into the pinnace
to await our return. And harkee, take warning."</p>

<p>Jack Cockrell felt almost sorry for his fallen foeman
but the other pirates grinned and did as they were told.
It was a trifling episode. Resuming his stroll to the
tavern, Captain Bonnet linked Jack's arm in his and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
fairly towed him along while the assorted scoundrels
trooped behind them. It was shocking company for a
lad of the most respectable connections but he felt
greatly flattered by the distinction. The name of Stede
Bonnet had spread terror from the Capes of the Chesapeake
to the blue waters of the Caribbean.</p>

<p>"And so you were unafraid of this bullying Will
Brant of mine," said the captain, with one of his pleasant
smiles. "You clipped his comb right handsomely.
And who may ye be, my brave young sprig?"</p>

<p>"I am John Spencer Cockrell, may it please you, sir,"
was the answer. "'Twas a small thing to do for a lady.
Your pirate would have been too much for me in a fair
set-to."</p>

<p>"Pirate? A poor word!" objected Captain Bonnet,
his accents severe but the bold eyes twinkling. "We
are loyal servants of the King, sworn to do mischief to
his lawful enemies,&mdash;to wit, all ships and sailors of
Spain. For such a young gentleman adventurer as you,
Master Cockrell, there is a berth in the <i>Royal James</i>.
Will ye rendezvous at the tavern and sign your fist to
the articles?"</p>

<p>Jack stammered that his kinfolk would never consent,
at which Captain Bonnet forbore to coax him but kept
a grip on his arm as though they were chums who could
not bear to be parted. Down the middle of the street
paraded this extraordinary company, the seamen breaking
into a song which ran:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>"In Bristowe I left Poll ashore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Well stored wi' togs an' gold,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And off I go to sea for more,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A-piratin' so bold.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">An' wounded in the arm I got,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' then a pretty blow;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Comed home I find Poll's flowed away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><i>Yo, ho, with the rum below!</i>"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Charles Town might be glad to get the pirates' gold
but it seemed a timorous welcome, for the merchants
peered from their doorways like rabbits when the hounds
are loose, and nervous old gentlemen took cover in the
near-by alleys. Stede Bonnet knew how to keep his men
in hand and allowed only part of the company ashore at
once. They were like hilarious children out for a lark,
capering outside the tavern to the music of a strolling
fiddler or buying horses on the spot and trying to ride
them. When they were pitched off on their heads the
mirth was uproarious.</p>

<p>In a field beside the tavern some townsmen were
shooting at a mark for a prize of a dressed bullock while
a group of gentlemen from the plantations were intent
on a cock-fight in the tap-room. Here was rare pastime
for the frolicsome blades of the <i>Royal James</i> and soon
they were banging away with their pistols or betting
their gold-pieces on the steel-gaffed birds, singing the
louder as the bottle was passed. Captain Stede Bonnet
stayed prudently sober, ready for any emergency, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
demeanor cool and watchful while he chatted with old
acquaintances.</p>

<p>He talked often with Jack Cockrell to whom he had
taken a strong fancy, and pressed the lad to dine with
him. Jack was uneasy at being seen so publicly with a
notorious pirate but the experience was delightful beyond
words. The captain asked him many questions,
twisting his mustachios and staring down from his commanding
height with an air of friendly interest. He
had found a lad after his own heart.</p>

<p>The seamen tired of their sport and sought new diversion.
Some of them kicked off their boots and
clinched in wrestling matches for prodigal stakes of
gold and jewels. Others found girls to dance with them
or wandered off to buy useless trinkets in the shops.
Jack Cockrell knew he ought to be posting home to
dinner but he was tempted to accept Stede Bonnet's
cordial bidding. Boyish friends of his hovered near and
regarded him as a hero. No pirate captain had ever
deigned to notice them.</p>

<p>Alas for Jack and his puffed-up pride which was
doomed to a sudden fall! There advanced from a better
quarter of the town a florid, foppishly dressed gentleman
of middle age who walked with a pompous gait.
He was stout-bodied and the heat of the day oppressed
him. Mopping his face with a lace handkerchief or
fanning himself with his hat, he halted now and then in
a shady spot. Very mindful of his rank and dignity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
was Mr. Peter Arbuthnot Forbes, sometime London
barrister, at present Secretary to the Council of the
Province.</p>

<p>He differed from some of his neighbors in that he
abominated pirates and would have given them short
shift. A trifle near-sighted, he was quite close to the
tavern before he espied his own nephew and ward, Jack
Cockrell, in this shameful company of roisterers. The
august uncle blinked, opened his mouth, and turned as
red as a lobster. Indignation choked his speech. For
his part, Jack stood dumfounded and quaking, the picture
of a coward with a guilty conscience. He would
have tried to steal from sight but it was too late.</p>

<p>Captain Stede Bonnet enjoyed the tableau and several
of his wicked sailors were mimicking the pompous
strut of Mr. Peter Arbuthnot Forbes. Poor Jack
mumbled some explanation but his irate uncle first paid
his respects to Captain Bonnet.</p>

<p>"Shame to you, sirrah," he cried in a voice that shook
with passion. "A man of good birth, by all accounts,
who has fallen so low as to lead these vile gallows-birds!
And you would entice this lad of mine to follow your
dirty trade?"</p>

<p>Captain Bonnet doffed the great beaver hat and
bowed low in mocking courtesy. He perceived that this
fussy lawyer was not wholly a popinjay, for it required
courage to insult a pirate to his face. The reply was
therefore milder than expected.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mayhap I am painted blacker than the fact, Councilor.
As for this fine stripling who has so disgraced
himself, the fault is mine. He risked his life to save a
maid from harm. The deed won my affection."</p>

<p>"The maids of Charles Town would need to fear no
harm if more pirates were hanged, Captain Bonnet,"
roundly declared Mr. Forbes, shaking his gold-tipped
cane at the freebooter.</p>

<p>"'Tis fortunate for me that you lack the power, my
fat and petulant gentleman," was the smiling response.</p>

<p>"Laugh while you may," quoth the other. "These
Provinces may soon proclaim joint action against such
pests as you."</p>

<p>With a shrug, the Secretary turned to his crestfallen
nephew and sharply exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Home with you, John Cockrell. You shall go dinnerless
and be locked in your room."</p>

<p>The seamen guffawed at this and Jack furiously resented
their ridicule. He was on the point of rebellion
as he hotly retorted:</p>

<p>"I am no child to be treated thus, Uncle Peter.
Didn't you hear Captain Bonnet report that I had
proved myself a man? I trounced one of his own crew,
a six-foot bully with a dirk and pistols."</p>

<p>"A fig for that," rapped out Uncle Peter. "Your
bully was drunk and helpless, I have no doubt. Will
you bandy words with me?"</p>

<p>With this his plump fingers closed on Jack's elbow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
which he used as a handle to lead him firmly and rapidly
away. Behind them pranced a limber young negro who
showed every tooth in his head. Jack heard the derisive
laughter of the pirates who had hailed him as a hero.
His cup of bitterness overflowed when it occurred to
him that Captain Bonnet would despise a lad who could
be led home in custody of a dandified tyrant of an uncle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE MERCHANT TRADER, <i>PLYMOUTH ADVENTURE</i></h3>


<div class='unindent'><big>R</big>UBBING his ear which Mr. Peter Arbuthnot
Forbes had soundly boxed before releasing him,
Jack marched along in gloomy silence until he
was conducted into his small, unplastered room. His
uncle stalked out and shot the ponderous bolt behind
him. Passing through the kitchen, he halted to scold
the black cook as a lazy slattern and then sat himself
down to a lonely meal. Jack was a problem which the
finicky, middle-aged bachelor had been unable to solve.
He had undertaken the care of the boy after his parents
had died in the same week of a mysterious fever which
ravaged the settlement. The uncle failed to realize how
fast this strapping youngster was growing into manhood.
He disliked punishing him and was usually unhappy
after one of these stormy episodes.</div>

<p>Mr. Peter Forbes pecked at his dinner with little
appetite and his plump face was clouded. Shoving back
his chair, he paced the floor in a fidgety manner and, at
length, opened the door of Jack's room. The hungry
prisoner was lounging upon a wooden settle, his chin in
his hand, while he sullenly stared at the wall. Always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
mindful of his manners, he slowly rose to his feet and
waited for another scolding.</p>

<p>"I wish we might avoid such scenes as these, Jack,"
sadly observed Uncle Peter, his hot temper cooled.
"No sooner do you leave my sight than some new mischief
is afoot."</p>

<p>"You do not understand, sir," impatiently protested
the nephew. "In your eyes I am still the urchin who
came out from England clinging to his dear mother's
skirts. Would ye have me pass my time with girls or
have no other friends than snuffy old Parson Throckmorton,
my tutor, who tries to pound the Greek and
Latin into my thick skull?"</p>

<p>"He is a wise and ripened scholar who wastes his
effort," was the dry comment. "Most of the lads of the
town are coarse louts who pattern after their ribald
elders, Jack. They will lead you into evil courses."</p>

<p>"I shall always pray God to be a gentleman, sir,"
was the spirited response, "but I must learn to fight
my own battles. Were it not for hardy pastimes with
these other stout lads, think you I could have cracked the
crown of a six-foot pirate?"</p>

<p>Uncle Peter gazed at the boy before he spoke.
Tanned and hard and muscular, this was a nephew to
be proud of, a man in deeds if not in years, and there
was unswerving honesty in the straight mouth and firm
chin. The guardian sighed and then annoyance got the
better of his affection as he burst out:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perdition take all pirates! You were cozened by
this hell-rake of a Stede Bonnet and thought it a rare
pleasure! John Spencer Cockrell, own nephew to the
Secretary of the Colony!"</p>

<p>"I did but copy older men of fair repute," demurely
answered Jack, a twinkle in his eye. "Graybeards of
Parson Throckmorton's flock traffick in merchandise
with the pirates and are mighty civil to them, I note."</p>

<p>"A vile business!" cried Uncle Peter. "It was decided
at the recent conference in Virginia that I should
go to England as a delegate to lay before His Majesty's
Government such evidence as might invoke aid in our
campaign against the pirates. It was my intention to
leave you in care of Parson Throckmorton, Jack, but
I have now resolved to take you with me. And you
will remain at school in England. No more of this boon
comradeship with villains like Stede Bonnet."</p>

<p>Poor Jack looked most unhappy at the tidings. It
was not at all in accord with his ambitions. Here was
worse punishment than he had dreamed his uncle could
inflict. Dolefully he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"To live in tame and stupid England, locked up in a
school? Why, I am big enough to join the forays
against the Indians, or to fight bloody battles against
the pirates if you really mean to chastise them. But I
cannot promise to attack Captain Bonnet. He is a
friend of mine."</p>

<p>"You shall come to see him hanged," shouted Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Peter Arbuthnot Forbes, very red in the face. "The
merchant ship <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> is expected soon,
and you and I shall take passage in her for Merry England,
thanking heaven to see the last of the barbarous
Carolinas for a time."</p>

<p>"Thank your own thanks, sir," grumbled Jack.
"Captain Bonnet may be a pirate but he is not nearly
so heartless as my own uncle. He asked me to dinner
at the tavern. I am faint for lack of food. My stomach
sticks to my ribs. 'Tis a great pity you were never a
growing boy yourself. For a platter of cold meat and
bread I will take my oath to chop you a pile of firewood
as high as the kitchen."</p>

<p>The gaoler relented and bustled out to ransack the
pantry. Having demolished a joint and a loaf, young
John Spencer Cockrell was in a mood much less melancholy.
In fact, when he swung the axe behind the fence
of hewn palings, he was humming the refrain of that
wicked ditty: "<i>Yo, Ho, with the Rum Below!</i>" He
was tremendously sorry that he had been snatched away
from the engaging society of Captain Bonnet and his
wild crew, and the future had a gloomy aspect, but even
these grievances were forgotten when he descried, in a
lane which led past the house, the lovely maid whose
cause he had championed at the wharf.</p>

<p>She was Dorothy, only daughter of Colonel Malcolm
Stuart who commanded the militia forces of the Colony.
Although she was the elder by two or three years and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
gave herself the airs of a young lady, Jack Cockrell
hopelessly, secretly adored her. It was an anti-climax
for a hero to be serving out his sentence at the wood-pile
and he turned his back to the gate while he made
the chips fly. But Dorothy had no intention of ignoring
him. She paused with a smile so winsome that Jack's
heart fluttered and he dropped the axe to grasp her outstretched
hand. He squeezed it so hard that Dorothy
winced as she said:</p>

<p>"What a masterful man it is, but please don't crush
my poor fingers. I fled from those pirates at the wharf,
Jack, instead of waiting to offer you my most humble
thanks. Will you accept them now? They come
straight from the heart."</p>

<p>For such a reward as this Jack would have fought a
dozen pirates. Baring his head, he murmured bashfully:</p>

<p>"A trifling service, Mistress Dorothy, and 'tis my
devout hope that I may always be ready in time of
need."</p>

<p>"So?" she exclaimed, with mischief in her eyes. "I
believe you would slay a pirate each morning before
breakfast, should I ask it."</p>

<p>"Or any other small favors like that," gallantly returned
Jack.</p>

<p>"A proper courtier," cried Dorothy. "My father
will thank you when he returns from North Carolina.
When I ventured to the wharf this morning it was in
hopes of sighting his armed sloop."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The dwelling of Mr. Peter Arbuthnot Forbes was at
some distance from the tavern which was on the sloping
ground that overlooked the harbor, among the spreading
live-oaks and magnolias. Borne on the breeze came
the sounds of Stede Bonnet's pirates at their revels,
pistol shots, wild choruses, drunken yells. Jack was not
disturbed although Mistress Dorothy moved closer and
laid a hand on his arm. Presently the tumult ceased,
abruptly, and now Jack was perplexed. It might mean
a sudden recall to the ship. Something was in the wind.
The youth and the maid stood listening. Jack was
about to scramble to the roof of the house in order to
gaze toward the harbor but Dorothy bade him stay with
her. Her fair cheek had paled and she shivered with a
vague apprehension.</p>

<p>This sudden stillness was uncanny, threatening.
Soon, however, a trumpet blew a long, shrill call to
arms, and they heard one hoarse, jubilant huzza after
another.</p>

<p>"Have Stede Bonnet's pirates mustered to sack the
town?" implored Dorothy.</p>

<p>"I can speedily find out," replied her protector.</p>

<p>"Oh, I pray you not to leave me," she tremulously
besought him.</p>

<p>"Captain Bonnet will wreak no harm on Charles
Town," Jack assured her. "I know him too well for
that. You saw what he did to the base varlet who annoyed
you at the wharf,&mdash;felled him like an ox."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"If only my father were here, to call out the troops
and rout this rabble of sea rogues, Jack dear," was her
fluttering prayer.</p>

<p>A little after this, the tumult increased and it was
drawing nearer. It was a martial clamor of men on the
march, with the rattle of drums and a loud fanfare of
trumpets. Mr. Peter Arbuthnot Forbes came running
out of the house, all flustered and waving his hands, and
ordered the two young people indoors. The servants
were closing the heavy wooden shutters and sliding the
bars across the doors.</p>

<p>Jack slipped out into the lane and hailed a neighbor
who dashed past. The news was babbled in fragments
and Jack scurried back to blurt to his uncle:</p>

<p>"An Indian raid,&mdash;the savages are within a dozen
miles of Charles Town, laying waste the plantations,&mdash;slaying
the laborers. The militia is called to arms but
they lack a leader. Colonel Stuart is sorely missed.
Captain Bonnet called another boat-load of his pirates
ashore, and they march in the van to assail the Indians.
May I go with them, Uncle Peter? Must I play the
coward and the laggard?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, John Cockrell. These mad pirates have
addled your wits. Shall I let you be scalped by these
painted fiends of Yemassees?"</p>

<p>"Then you will volunteer in my stead," shrewdly
ventured Jack, with a glance at Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Um-m. Duty and my official cares prevent," quoth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the worshipful Secretary of the Colony, frowning and
pursing his lips. Dorothy smiled at this and winked at
Jack. Uncle Peter was rated a better lawyer than a
valiant man of war.</p>

<p>"Let us stand at a window," exclaimed the girl.
"Ah, they come! My faith, but this is a brave array.
And Captain Bonnet leads them well."</p>

<p>She had never expected to praise a pirate but there
was no denying that this lean, straight rover in the scarlet
coat and great cocked hat looked the part of a competent
and intrepid soldier. He was superbly fit for the
task in hand. Catching sight of Jack Cockrell and
Dorothy Stuart in the window, he saluted by raising the
hilt of his cutlass and his melancholy visage brightened
in a smile.</p>

<p>Behind him tramped his men in column of fours,
matchlocks across their shoulders, bright weapons
swinging against their thighs as they sang all together
and kept step to the beat of the drums.</p>

<div class='poem'>"But ere to Execution Bay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The wind these bones do blow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I'll drink an' fight what's left away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><i>Yo, ho, with the rum below</i>."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Behind these hardy volunteers straggled as many of
the militia company as had been able to answer the sudden
call, merchants, clerks, artisans, and vagabonds who
seemed none too eager to meet the bloodthirsty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Yemassees. Their wives and children trailed after them
to the edge of the town, amidst tears and loud lamentations.
The contrast did not escape the eye of Mr. Peter
Arbuthnot Forbes who reluctantly admitted:</p>

<p>"Give the devil his due, say I. These wicked
brethren of the coast go swaggering off of their own
free will, as though it were to a frolic. I will remember
it in their favor when they come to hang."</p>

<p>A long roll of the drums and a lilting flourish by the
pirate trumpeter as a farewell to Charles Town and its
tavern and its girls, and the company passed from view.
The lane was again deserted and silent and Jack offered
to escort Dorothy Stuart to her own home. As they
loitered across an open field, he cried in a fierce flare of
rebellion:</p>

<p>"My good uncle will drive me too far. Let him sail
for old England and leave me to find my own career.
Upon my soul, I may run away to join a pirate ship."</p>

<p>Dorothy tried to look grave at this dreadful announcement
but a dimple showed in her cheek as she replied:</p>

<p>"My dear Jack, you can never be braver but you
will be wiser some day. Banish such silly thoughts.
You must obey your lawful guardian."</p>

<p>"But did you see the lads in the militia company?
Two or three of them I have whipped in fair fight.
And Uncle Peter wants to keep me tucked in a cradle."</p>

<p>"Softly, Jack," said she, with pretty solicitude.
"Stede Bonnet has bewitched you utterly."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>The stubborn youth shook his head. This day of
humiliation had been the last straw. He was ripe for
desperate adventure. It would have made him happy
and contented to be marching against the Indians with
Stede Bonnet and his cut-throats, in peril of tomahawks
and ambuscades.</p>

<p>Small wonder that poor Jack Cockrell's notions of
right and wrong were rather confused, for he lived in
an age when might ruled blue water, when every ship
was armed and merchant seamen fought to save their
skins as well as their cargoes. English, French, Spanish,
and Dutch, they plundered each other on the flimsiest
pretexts and the pirates harried them all.</p>

<p>Still sulky, Jack betook himself to the rectory next
morning for his daily bout with his studies. Parson
Throckmorton was puttering in the garden, a shrunken
little man who wore black small-clothes, lace at his
wrists, and a powdered wig. Opening the silver snuff-box
he almost sneezed the wig off before he chirruped:</p>

<p>"Ye mind me of Will Shakespeare's whining schoolboy,
Master John,&mdash;creeping like snail unwillingly to
school. A treat is in store for us to-day, a signal treat!
We begin our Virgil. '<i>Arma virumque cano.</i>'"</p>

<p>"Arms and a man? I like that much of it," glowered
the mutinous scholar, "but my uncle makes me sing a
different tune."</p>

<p>"He accepted my advice,&mdash;that you be educated in
England," said the parson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I may hold you responsible for this hellish
thing?" angrily declaimed Jack. "Were it not for your
white hairs&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He subsided and had the grace to apologize as they
entered the library. The tutor was an impatient old
gentleman and the pupil was so inattentive that his
knuckles were sharply rapped with a ruler. A blunder
more glaring and the ruler came down with another
whack. This was too much for Jack who jumped up,
rubbed his knuckles, and shouted:</p>

<p>"Enough, sir. I would have you know that I all but
killed a big, ugly pirate yesterday."</p>

<p>"So rumor informs me," rasped Parson Throckmorton,
"but you will give yourself no grand airs with me.
Construe this passage properly or I must tan those
leather breeches with a limber rod."</p>

<p>This was too much for the insulted Jack who slammed
down the book, clapped on his hat, and tramped from
the room in high dudgeon. Such scurvy treatment as
this was fairly urging him to a life of crime on the rolling
ocean. He wandered down to the wharf and wistfully
gazed at the lawless brig, <i>Royal James</i>, which
swam at her anchorage in trim and graceful beauty. A
few men moved briskly on deck, painting the bulwarks
or polishing brass. Evidently Stede Bonnet had sent
off word to be all taut and ready to hoist sail for another
cruise.</p>

<p>After a while the truant went homeward and manfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
confessed to the quarrel with Parson Throckmorton.
Uncle Peter Forbes was amazingly mild. There
was no gusty outbreak of temper and, in fact, he had
little to say. It was in his mind to patch up a truce
with his troublesome nephew pending their departure
for England. He even suggested that the studies be
dropped and advised Jack to go fishing in his canoe.</p>

<p>Several days later, Captain Bonnet and his pirates
came back from their foray against the Indians. They
were a foot-sore, weary band, the wounded carried in
litters and several men missing. Their gay garments
were caked with mud, the finery all tatters, and most of
them were marked with cuts and scratches, but they
pulled themselves together and swaggered into Charles
Town as boldly as ever to the music of trumpet and
drum. Stede Bonnet carried an arm in a sling. As he
passed the Secretary's house he cheerily called out to
Jack:</p>

<p>"Ahoy, my young comrade! 'Twill please you to
know that fair Mistress Dorothy Stuart may sleep in
peace."</p>

<p>"Did you scatter the savages, sir?" asked Jack, running
out to shake his hand.</p>

<p>"God bless ye, boy, we exterminated 'em."</p>

<p>The gratitude of Mr. Peter Arbuthnot Forbes was
stronger than his dislike and he came out to thank the
captain in behalf of the citizens of Charles Town. To
his excited questions the pirate replied:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"There be old buccaneers from Hispaniola in
my crew, may it please Your Excellency,&mdash;fellows who
hunted the Indians in their youth,&mdash;tracked 'em like
hounds through forest and bayou. Others served their
time with the log-wood cutters of Yucatan. They
laughed at the tricks of these Yemassees of the Carolinas."</p>

<p>One of the militia company broke in to say to Mr.
Forbes:</p>

<p>"Your Honor's own plantation was saved from the
torch by this doughty Captain Bonnet. It was there he
pulled the flint arrow-head from his arm and was near
bleeding to death."</p>

<p>Mr. Peter Forbes could do no less than invite the
pirate into the house, for the wounded arm had been
rudely bandaged and was in sore need of dressing. Jack
fetched a tray of cakes and wine while his uncle bawled
at the servants who came running with soft cloths and
hot water and healing lotions. Captain Bonnet protested
that the hurt was trifling and carelessly explained:</p>

<p>"My own ship's surgeon was spitted on a boarding-pike
in our last action at sea and I have not found me
another one. You show much skill and tenderness, sir."</p>

<p>"The wound is deep and ragged. Hold still," commanded
Mr. Peter Forbes. "You have been a soldier,
Captain Bonnet, commended for valor on the fields of
Europe and holding the king's commission. Why not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
seek pardon and serve with the armed forces of this
province? My services in the matter are yours to command."</p>

<p><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Steve'">Stede</ins> Bonnet frowned and bit his lip. All he said
was:</p>

<p>"You meddle with matters that concern you not,
my good sir. I am a man able to make my own free
choice."</p>

<p>"Captain Bonnet does honor to the trade of piracy,"
cried the admiring Jack, at which his uncle declared,
with a wrathful gesture:</p>

<p>"I must remove this daft lad to England to be rid
of you, Stede Bonnet. You have cast a wicked spell
over him."</p>

<p>"To England?" said the pirate, with a sympathetic
glance at the boy. "I would sooner lie in gaol."</p>

<p>"And reap your deserts," snapped Uncle Peter.</p>

<p>"No doubt of that," frankly agreed the pirate.
"And what thinks the lad of this sad penance?"</p>

<p>"I hate it," was Jack's swift answer. "Will you
grant our merchant ship safe conduct, Captain Bonnet?"</p>

<p>"What ship, boy? You have only to name her. She
will go scathless, as far as in my power."</p>

<p>"The <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>," replied Jack. "It
would ruin my uncle's temper beyond all mending to be
taken by pirates."</p>

<p>"I pledge you my word," swore Stede Bonnet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
"Moreover, if trouble befall you by sea or land, Master
Cockrell, I pray you send me tidings and you will have
a friend in need."</p>

<p>That night those who dwelt near the harbor heard
the clank of a windlass as the crew of the <i>Royal James</i>
hove the cable short, and the melodious, deep-throated
refrain of a farewell chantey floated across the quiet
water. With the flood of the tide and a landward breeze,
the brig stole out across the bar while the topsails were
sheeted home. When daylight dawned, she had vanished
in the empty reaches of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The brig sailed without Jack Cockrell. His shrewd
uncle saw to that. It was not by accident that a constable
of the town watch loitered in the lane by the Secretary's
house. And Uncle Peter himself was careful
not to let the lad out of his sight until the beguiling
Stede Bonnet had left his haunts in Charles Town.
Life resumed its routine next day but the boy's whole
current of thought had been changed. He was restless,
craving some fresh excitement and hoping that more
pirates might come roaring to the tavern green.</p>

<p>He found welcome diversion when the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>,
merchant trader, arrived from London after a
famous passage of thirty-two days to the westward.
Her master's orders were to make quick dispatch and
return with freight and passengers direct from Charles
Town. Jack was given no more leisure to brood over
his own misfortunes. There were many errands to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
done for Mr. Peter Forbes, besides the chests and boxes
to be packed and stoutly corded. As was the custom,
they had to supply their own furniture for the cabin in
the ship and Jack Cockrell enjoyed the frequent trips
aboard.</p>

<p>He found much to interest him in the sedate, bearded
Captain Jonathan Wellsby of the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>,
in the crew of hearty British tars who feared neither man
nor devil, in the battery of nine-pounders, the stands of
boarding-pikes, and the triced hammock nettings to protect
the vessel against hand-to-hand encounters with pirates.
The voyage might be worth while, after all.
There were to be a dozen of passengers, several ladies
among them. The most distinguished was Mr. Peter
Arbuthnot Forbes, Secretary of the Provincial Council,
who was accorded the greatest respect and given the
largest cabin.</p>

<p>It was an important event when the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>
hoisted all her bunting on sailing day and
Charles Town flocked to the harbor with wistful envy of
the lucky people who were bound home to old England.
There were sad faces among those left behind to endure
the perils, hardships and loneliness of pioneers. Jack
Cockrell's heart beat high when he saw sweet Dorothy
Stuart in the throng. He tarried ashore with her until
the boatswain's pipe trilled from the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>
to summon the passengers on board. Colonel
Stuart, blonde and bronzed and stalwart, escorted his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
winsome daughter and he praised Jack for his deed of
courage, telling him:</p>

<p>"There will soon be fewer pirates for you to trounce,
I hope, my lad."</p>

<p>"The town will be a stupid place without a visit from
the jolly rovers now and then," honestly replied Jack,
at which Colonel Stuart laughed and his daughter suggested:</p>

<p>"With my brave knight in distant England, deliver
me from any more pirates."</p>

<p>Jack blushed and was both happy and sad when the
dear maid took a flower from her bodice and gave it to
him as a token of remembrance. He solemnly tucked
it away in a pocket, stammered his farewells, and went
to join his uncle who waited in the yawl at the wharf.
Once on board the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>, they were
swept into a bustle and confusion. Captain Jonathan
Wellsby was in haste to catch a fair wind and make his
offing before nightfall. His sailors ran to and fro,
jumping at the word, active and cheery. Stately and
slow, the high-pooped merchant trader filled away on
the larboard tack and pointed her lofty bowsprit seaward.</p>

<p>The watches were set, ropes coiled down, and the
tackles of the cannon overhauled. The skipper paced
the after-deck, a long telescope under his arm, while the
passengers lined the rail and gazed at the rude settlement
that was slowly dropping below the horizon. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
sea was tranquil and the breeze steady. The ship was
clothed in canvas which bellied to drive her eastward
with a frothing wake. Safely she left the outer bar
astern and wallowed in the ocean swell.</p>

<p>The afternoon sun was sinking when a sail gleamed
like a bit of cloud against the southerly sky. Captain
Wellsby held to his course and showed no uneasiness.
Soon another sail became visible and then a third, these
two smaller than the first. They might be honest merchantmen
steering in company, but the skipper consulted
with his mates and the spy-glass passed from hand
to hand. The passengers were at supper in the cuddy
and their talk and laughter came through the open skylights.</p>

<p>Presently the boatswain piped the crew to quarters
and the men moved quietly to their battle stations, opening
the gun-ports and casting loose the lashings. The
boys fetched paper cartridges of powder in buckets from
the magazine and the gunners lighted the matches of
tow. Cutlasses were buckled on and the pikes were
scattered along the bulwarks ready to be snatched up.</p>

<p>It was impossible to escape these three strange vessels
by beating back to Charles Town, for the <i>Plymouth
Adventure</i> made lubberly work of it when thrashing to
windward. She was a swift ship, however, before a fair
wind, and Captain Wellsby resolved to run for it, hoping
to edge away from danger if his suspicions should
be confirmed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Before sunset the largest of the strange sail shifted
her course as though to set out in chase and overhaul the
deep-laden merchant trader. Captain Wellsby stood
near the tiller, his hands clasped behind him, a solid,
dependable figure of a British mariner. The passengers
were crowding around him in distressful agitation but
he calmly assured them a stern chase was a long chase
and he expected to slip away under cover of night. So
far as he was aware, no pirates, excepting Stede Bonnet,
had been recently reported in these waters.</p>

<p>Here Mr. Peter Forbes broke in to say that the
<i>Plymouth Adventure</i> had naught to fear from Captain
Bonnet who had pledged his word to let her sail unmolested.
Other passengers scoffed at the absurd notion
of trusting a pirate's oath, but the pompous Secretary
of the Council could not be cried down. He was
a canny critic of human nature and he knew an honorable
pirate when he met him.</p>

<p>It was odd, but in a pinch like this the dapper, finicky
Councilor Peter Arbuthnot Forbes displayed an unshaken
courage as became a gentleman of his position,
while young Jack Cockrell had suddenly changed his
opinion of the fascinating trade of piracy. He had not
the slightest desire to investigate it at any closer range.
His knees were inclined to wobble and his stomach felt
qualms. His uncle twitted him as a braggart ashore who
sang a different tune afloat. The lad's grin was feeble
as he retorted that he took his pirates one at a time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The largest vessel of the pursuit came up at a tremendous
pace, reeling beneath an extraordinary spread
of canvas, her spray-swept hull disclosing an armament
of thirty guns, the decks swarming with men. She was
no merchant ship, this was already clear, but there was
still the hope that she might be a man-of-war or a privateer.
Captain Wellsby looked in vain for her colors.
At length he saw a flag whip from the spanker gaff.
He laid down the glass with a profound sigh.</p>

<p>The flag was black with a sinister device, a white
blotch whose outline suggested a human skull.</p>

<p>Captain Wellsby gazed again and carefully examined
the two sloops which were acting in concert with the
thirty-gun ship. It was a squadron, and the brave
<i>Plymouth Adventure</i> was hopelessly outmatched. To
fight meant a slaughter with never a chance of survival.</p>

<p>The passengers had made no great clamor until the
menacing ship drew close enough for them to descry the
dreadful pennant which showed as a sable blot against
the evening sky. Two women fainted and others were
seized with violent hysteria. Their shrill screams were
so distressing that the skipper ordered them to be lugged
below and shut in their cabins. Mr. Peter Forbes had
plumped himself down upon a coil of hawser, as if utterly
disgusted, but he implored the captain to blaze
away at the besotted scoundrels as long as two planks
held together. The Honorable Secretary of the Council<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
had been too outspoken in his opinions of pirates to expect
kindness at their hands.</p>

<p>The sailors also expected no quarter but they sullenly
crouched at the gun-carriages, gripping the handspikes
and blowing the matches while they waited for the word.
The pirate ship was now reaching to windward of the
<i>Plymouth Adventure</i>, heeling over until her decks were
in full view. Upon the poop stood a man of the most
singular appearance. He was squat and burly and immensely
broad across the shoulders. What made him
grotesque was a growth of beard which swept almost to
his waist and covered his face like a hairy curtain. In
it were tied bright streamers of crimson ribbon. Evidently
this fantastic monster was proud of his whiskers
and liked to adorn them.</p>

<p>The laced hat with a feather in it, the skirted coat of
buff and blue which flapped around his bow-legs, and
the rows of gold buttons across his chest were in slovenly
imitation of a naval uniform. But there was nothing
like naval discipline on those crowded decks where half
the crew appeared to be drunk and the rest of them
cursing each other.</p>

<p>Captain Jonathan Wellsby smothered a groan and his
stern mouth twitched as he said to his chief mate:</p>

<p>"God's mercy on us! 'Tis none other than the bloody
Edward Teach,&mdash;that calls himself Blackbeard! My information
was that he still cruised off the Spanish Main
and refitted his ships in the Bay of Honduras."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"The madman of the sea," said the stolid mate. "A
bad day for us when he sailed to the north'ard. He kills
for the pleasure of it. Now Stede Bonnet loots such
stuff as takes his fancy and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He loves to fight a king's ship for the sport of it,"
broke in the skipper, "but this murderer&mdash;&mdash; An unlucky
voyage for the old <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> and all
hands, Mate."</p>

<p>One of the women who had been suffered to remain
on deck was close enough to overhear the direful news.
Her hands to heaven, she wailed:</p>

<p>"Blackbeard! Oh, my soul, we are as good as dead,
or worse. Fight and sink him, dear captain. What
shall I do? What shall I do? If I had only minded
the dream I had the night before we sailed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jack Cockrell sat down beside his uncle, a limp and
sorry youth for one who had offered to slay a six-foot
pirate before breakfast to please a pretty maid. With
a sickly grin he murmured:</p>

<p>"This cockerel crowed too loud, Uncle Peter. Methinks
I share your distaste for piracy."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>HELD AS HOSTAGES TO BLACKBEARD</h3>


<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>O discover the pestilent Blackbeard in Carolina
waters was like a thunderbolt from a clear sky.
Captain Wellsby had felt confident that he
could beat off the ordinary pirate craft which was apt
to be smaller than his own stout ship. And most of
these unsavory gentry were mere salt-water burglars
who had little taste for hard fighting. The master of
the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>, so pious and sedate, was a
brave man to whom the thought of surrender was intolerable.
From what he knew of Blackbeard, it was useless
to try to parley for the lives of his passengers. Better
it was to answer with double-shotted guns than to
beg for mercy.</div>

<p>The British tars, stripped to the waist, turned anxious
eyes to the skipper upon the quarter-deck while
they quaffed pannikins of rum and water and cracked
many a rough jest. They fancied death no more than
other men, but seafaring was a perilous trade and they
were toughened to its hazards. They were facing hopeless
odds but let the master shout the command and they
would send the souls of some of these pirates sizzling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
down to hell before the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> sank, a
splintered hulk, in the smoke of her own gunpowder.</p>

<p>Captain Wellsby delayed his decision a moment
longer. Something most unusual had attracted his attention.
A ball of smoke puffed from a port of Blackbeard's
ship, but the round shot splashed beyond the
bowsprit of the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> instead of thudding
into her oaken side. This was a signal to heave to.
It was a courtesy both unexpected and perplexing, because
Blackbeard's habit was to let fly with all the guns
that could bear as the summons to submit. Presently
a dingy bit of cloth fluttered just beneath the black flag.
It looked like the remains of a pirate's shirt which had
once been white.</p>

<p>"A signal for a truce?" muttered Captain Wellsby.
"A ruse, mayhap, but the rogue has no need to resort to
trickery."</p>

<p>The two sloops of Blackbeard's squadron, spreading
tall, square topsails, came driving down to windward in
readiness to fire their bow-chasers and form in line of
battle. The passengers of the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>,
snatching at the chance of safety, implored the skipper
to send his men away from the guns lest a rash shot
might be their ruin. They prayed him to respect the
precious flag of truce and to ascertain the meaning of it.
Mystified and wavering in his purpose, he told the mates
to back the main-yard and heave the ship to.</p>

<p>Upon his own deck Blackbeard was stamping to and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
fro, bellowing at his crew while he flourished a broadsword
by way of emphasis. The hapless company of
the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> shivered at the very sight of
him and yet there was something almost ludicrous in the
antics of this atrocious pirate, as though he were play-acting
upon the stage of a theatre. He had tucked up
the tails of his military coat because the wind whipped
them about his bandy legs and made him stumble. The
flowing whiskers also proved bothersome, wherefore he
looped them back over his ears by means of the bows
of crimson ribbon. This seemed to be his personal
fashion of clearing for action.</p>

<p>"There be pirates and pirates," critically observed
Mr. Peter Forbes as he stared at the unpleasant Blackbeard.
"This is a filthy beast, Jack, and he was badly
brought up. He has no manners whatever."</p>

<p>"Parson Throckmorton would take him for the devil
himself," gloomily answered the lad.</p>

<p>And now they saw Blackbeard raise a speaking-trumpet
to his lips and heard the hoarse voice come down the
wind with this message:</p>

<p>"The ship ahoy! Steady as ye be, blast your eyes,
or I'll lay aboard and butcher all hands."</p>

<p>He turned and yelled commands to the two sloops
which now rolled within pistol-shot. In helter-skelter
style but with great speed, one boat after another was
lowered away and filled with armed pirates. They
rowed toward the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> and there were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
enough of them to carry her by boarding. In addition
to this, she was directly under the guns of Blackbeard's
powerful ship. One valorous young gentleman passenger
whipped out a rapier and swore to perish with
his face to the foe, but Captain Wellsby kicked him into
the cabin and fastened the scuttle. This was no time
for dramatics.</p>

<p>"It looks that the old ruffian comes on a peaceful
errand," said the skipper, by way of comfort. But the
hysterical ladies below decks redoubled their screams
and one substantial merchant of Charles Town scrambled
down to hide himself among them. Mr. Peter
Arbuthnot Forbes folded his arms and there was no
sign of weakness in his pink countenance. His dignity
still sustained him.</p>

<p>As agile as monkeys, the mob of pirates poured over
the bulwark, slashing through the hammock nettings,
and swept forward in a compact mass, driving Captain
Wellsby's seamen before them and penning them in the
forecastle. Having cleared the waist of the ship, they
loitered there until a few of them discovered the galley
and pantry. They swept the shelves and lockers bare
of food like a pack of famished wolves. Jack Cockrell
looked at them from the poop and perceived that they
were a gaunt, ragged lot. The skins of some were yellow
like parchment, and fits of trembling overtook them.
Something more than dissipation ailed them.</p>

<p>With a body-guard of the sturdiest men, Blackbeard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
clambered up the poop ladder and, with wicked oaths,
told the skipper to stand forth. Clean and trig and
carefully dressed, Captain Jonathan Wellsby confronted
these savage, unwashed pirates and calmly demanded
to know their errand. It was plain to read
that Blackbeard thought himself an imposing figure.
With a smirk and a grimace he bowed clumsily to a
woman on deck who had refused to desert her husband.
He growled like a bear at Captain Wellsby and prodded
the poor man with his cutlass as he thundered:</p>

<p>"You tried my patience, shipmaster, with your
cracking on sail. A little more and I'd ha' slit your
throat. Blood an' wounds, would ye dare to vex Blackbeard?"</p>

<p>Captain Wellsby faced him with unshaken composure
and returned in a strong voice:</p>

<p>"I beg no favors for myself but these helpless people,
women amongst them, came on board with my assurance
of safety. They have friends and kinsmen in Charles
Town who will ransom them in gold."</p>

<p>Blackbeard's mien was a shade less ferocious as he
cried:</p>

<p>"Gold? Can it cool a fever or heal a festering sore?
A score of my men are down and the others are tottering
ghosts. Medicines I must have. A foul plague on
those ports of the Spanish Main which laid my fine lads
by the heels."</p>

<p>Jack Cockrell, who had retreated to the taffrail, decided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
that this unkempt pirate was not so absurd as he
appeared. There was the strength of a giant in those
hulking shoulders and in the long arms which bulged the
coat-sleeves, and the man moved with a quickness which
made that clumsy air deceptive. The beard masked his
features but the eye was keen and roving, and he had a
trick of baring his teeth in a nasty snarl. He uttered
no more threats, however, and seemed to be anxiously
awaiting the reply of Captain Wellsby, who said:</p>

<p>"The few medicines and simples in my chest will not
suffice your need. Your ships are rotten with the
Spanish fever."</p>

<p>"A ransom, shipmaster?" exclaimed the pirate.
"'Twas in my mind when I flew a white flag for parley.
I will hold some of your fine passengers as hostages
while the others go in to rake Charles Town for medicines
to fetch back to my fleet."</p>

<p>"You will send my ship in?" asked the skipper.</p>

<p>"No! This <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> is my good prize
and I will overhaul the cargo and sink her at my leisure.
My ship will tack in to Charles Town bar. Then let the
messengers go in the long-boat to find the store of medicines.
Harkee, shipmaster,&mdash;two days, no longer, for
their return! Failing this, the hostages feed the fishes.
Such sport 'ud liven the hearts of my doleful seamen."</p>

<p>It was a shameful bargain, thus to submit to a pirate's
whim, but the wretched ship's company hailed it as a
glad surprise. They had stood in the shadow of death<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and this was a respite and a chance of salvation. Captain
Wellsby was heart-sick with humiliation but it was
not for him to take into his hands the fate of all these
others. Sadly he nodded assent. Jack Cockrell nudged
his uncle and whispered:</p>

<p>"Why doesn't he sail in with his three ships and take
what he likes? The town lies helpless against such a
force as this."</p>

<p>"Ssh-h, be silent," was the warning. "He is a wary
bird of prey and he fears a trap. He dare not attack
the port, since he lacks knowledge of its defenses."</p>

<p>Jack's cheek was rosy again and his knees had ceased
to tremble. There was no immediate prospect of walking
the plank. To be captured by Blackbeard was a
finer adventure than strutting arm-in-arm with Captain
Stede Bonnet. It was mournful, indeed, that Captain
Wellsby should have to lose his ship but 'tis an ill wind
that blows nobody good and the voyage to England,
which Jack had loathed from the bottom of his heart,
was indefinitely postponed. Such an experience as this
was apt to discourage Uncle Peter Forbes from trying
it again.</p>

<p>There were sundry chicken-hearted passengers anxious
to curry favor with Blackbeard, who gabbled when
they should have held their tongues, and in this manner
he learned that he had bagged the honorable Secretary
of the Provincial Council. The bewhiskered pirate
slapped his thighs and roared with glee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Damme, but he looks it! Alack that my sorry need
of medicines compels me to give quarter! Would I
might swing this fat Secretary from a topsail yard!
And a rogue of a lawyer to boot! He tempts me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I demand the courtesy due a hostage," exclaimed
Mr. Peter Forbes.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, you shall be my lackey,&mdash;the chief messenger,"
laughed Blackbeard, showing his yellow teeth.
"Hat in hand, begging medicines for me."</p>

<p>The honorable Secretary was near apoplexy. He
could only sputter and cough. He was to be sent as
an errand boy to the people of Charles Town, at the
brutal behest of this unspeakable knave, but refusal
meant death and there were his fellow captives to consider.
He thought of his nephew and was about to
plead that Jack be sent along with him when Blackbeard
demanded:</p>

<p>"What of the boy? He takes my eye. No pursy
swine of a lawyer could sire a lad of his brawn and
inches."</p>

<p>"I am Master Cockrell," Jack answered for himself,
"and I would have you more courteous to my worthy
uncle."</p>

<p>It was a speech so bold that the scourge of the Spanish
Main tugged at his whiskers with an air of comical
perplexity. The headstrong Jack was keen enough to
note that he had made an impression and he rashly
added:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tis not long since I knocked a pirate on the head
for incivility."</p>

<p>Mr. Peter Forbes gazed aghast, with slackened jaw,
expecting to see his mad nephew cut down by the sweep
of a broadsword, but Blackbeard merely grinned and
slapped the lad half-way across the deck with a buffet of
his open hand. Dizzily Jack picked himself up and was
furiously scolded by his uncle. Their lives hung by a
hair and this was no time to play the fool. For once,
however, Jack was the wiser of the two. In an amiable
humor Blackbeard exclaimed:</p>

<p>"And so this strapping young jackanapes knocks
pirates on the head! There be lazy dogs among my
men that well deserve it. You shall stay aboard, Master
Cockrell, whilst the juicy lubber of a lawyer
voyages into Charles Town. He may sweat an' strive
the more if I hold you as his security. Zounds, I'll
make a gentleman rover of ye, Jack, for I like your
mettle."</p>

<p>It was futile for the unhappy uncle to argue the matter.
He could only obey the tyrant's pleasure and hope
for a speedy return and the release of the terrified passengers.
The <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> was ordered to
haul her course to the westward and jog under easy sail
toward the Charles Town bar. Blackbeard was rowed
off to his own ship, the <i>Revenge</i>, leaving his sailing-master
and a prize crew. These amused themselves by
dragging the weeping women on deck and robbing them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of their jewels and money, but no worse violence was
offered. Middle-aged matrons and elderly spinsters,
they were neither young nor fair enough to be stolen as
pirates' brides.</p>

<p>The <i>Revenge</i> and the two sloops hovered within sight
of the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> and their sails gleamed
phantom-like in the darkness. There was little sleep
aboard the captured merchant trader. Some of the
pirates amused themselves with hauling chests and boxes
out of the cabins and spilling the contents about the deck
in riotous disorder. One sprightly outlaw arrayed himself
in a silken petticoat and flowered bodice and paraded
as a languishing lady with false curls until the
others pelted him with broken bottles and tar buckets.
By the flare of torches they ransacked the ship for provisions,
cordage, canvas, and heaped them ready to be
dumped into boats.</p>

<p>Jack Cockrell looked on until he was too drowsy to
stay awake and fell asleep on deck, his head pillowed on
his arm. Through the night the watches were changed
to the harsh summons of the pirate sailing-master or his
mate. Once Jack awoke when a seaman staggered into
the moonlight with blood running down his face. He
was not likely to be caught napping on watch again.</p>

<p>At dawn the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> was astir and the
<i>Revenge</i> ran close aboard to watch Mr. Peter Arbuthnot
Forbes and two prosperous merchants of Charles
Town bundled into the long-boat. Blackbeard shouted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
bloody threats through his trumpet, reminding them
that he would allow no more than two days' grace for
their errand ashore. Uncle Peter was deeply affected
as he embraced his nephew and kissed him on the cheek.
Jack's eyes were wet and he faltered, with unsteady
voice:</p>

<p>"Forgive me, sir, for all the trouble I have made you.
Never did I expect a parting like this."</p>

<p>"A barbarous coast, Jack, and a hard road to old England,"
smiled the Secretary of the Council. "Have a
stout heart. By God's grace I shall soon deliver you
from these sea vermin."</p>

<p>The boy watched the long-boat hoist sail with a grizzled,
scarred old boatswain from the <i>Revenge</i> at the
tiller. It drove for the blue fairway of the channel between
the frothing shoals of the bar and made brave
headway for the harbor. Then the ships stood out to
sea to go clear of a lee shore and the captives of the
<i>Plymouth Adventure</i> endured the harrowing suspense
with such courage as they could muster. Should any
accident delay the return of the long-boat beyond two
days, even head winds or foul weather, or if there was
lack of medicines in the town, they were doomed to
perish.</p>

<p>Jack Cockrell endured it with less anguish than the
other wretched hostages. He had the sublime confidence
of youth in its own destiny and he had found a
chum in a boyish pirate named Joseph Hawkridge who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
said he had sailed out of London as an apprentice seaman
in a ketch bound to Jamaica. He had been taken
out of his ship by Blackbeard, somewhere off the Azores,
and compelled to enlist or walk the plank. At first he
was made cook's scullion but because he was well-grown
and active, the chief gunner had taken him over as a
powder boy.</p>

<p>This Joe Hawkridge was a waif of the London slums,
hard and wise beyond his years, who had been starved
and abused ever since he could remember. He had fled
from cruel taskmasters ashore to endure the slavery of
the sea and to be kidnapped into piracy was no worse
than other things he had suffered. A gangling lad, with
a grin on his homely face, he had certain instincts of
manliness, of decent conduct, although he had known
only men whose souls were black with sin. Heaven
knows where he learned these cleaner aspirations.
They were like the reflection of a star in a muddy
pool.</p>

<p>It was easy for Jack Cockrell to win his confidence.
Few of his shipmates spoke kindly or showed pity for
him. And their youth drew them together. Jack's
motive was largely curiosity as soon as he discovered
that here was one of Blackbeard's crew ready to confide
in him. The two lads chatted in sheltered corners of the
deck, between watches, or met more freely in the night
hours. Jack shuddered at some of the tales that were
told him but he harkened breathless and asked for more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, this Blackbeard is the very wickedest pirate
that ever sailed," said Joe Hawkridge in the most matter-of-fact
tones. "You have found him merciful because
he fears a mortal sickness will sweep through his
ships."</p>

<p>"You have curdled my blood enough for now," admitted
Jack. "Tell me this. What do they say of
Captain Stede Bonnet? He chances to be a friend of
mine."</p>

<p>Joe Hawkridge ceased to grin. He was startled and
impressed. Real gentlemen like this young Cockrell
always told the truth. Making certain that they could
not be overheard, Joe whispered:</p>

<p>"What news of Stede Bonnet? You've seen him?
When? Did he cruise to the north'ard? Has he been
seen off Charles Town?"</p>

<p>"He came ashore not long ago, and invited me to dinner
at the tavern with him," bragged Jack. "And he
coaxed me to sign in his ship."</p>

<p>"Yes, you'd catch his eye, Cockrell, but listen! What
ship had he, and how many men? God strike me, but
I'll not tattle it. I'm true as steel to Stede Bonnet.
If you love me, don't breathe it here."</p>

<p>"There is no love lost betwixt him and Blackbeard?"
excitedly queried Jack.</p>

<p>"Mortal foes they be, if you ask Stede Bonnet."</p>

<p>Feeling sure he could trust this young Hawkridge,
Jack informed him:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stede Bonnet flies his pennant in a fine brig, the
<i>Royal James</i>, with seventy lusty rovers. But what
about him, Joe? Why does he hate this foul ogre of a
Blackbeard? Did they ever sail together?"</p>

<p>"'Twas in the Bay of Honduras. Captain Bonnet
was a green hand at the trade but zealous to win renown
at piratin'. And so he made compact with Blackbeard,
to sail as partners. There was Stede Bonnet with a fine
ship and his own picked crew. By treachery Blackbeard
stole the vessel from him. Bonnet and his men
were left to shift for 'emselves in a rotten old hulk that
was like to founder in a breeze o' wind."</p>

<p>"But they stayed afloat and took them a good ship,"
proudly exclaimed Jack, with a personal interest in the
venture.</p>

<p>"True, by what you say. D'ye see the <i>Revenge</i>
yonder, Blackbeard's tall cruiser? The very ship he
filched from Stede Bonnet by dirty stratagem and
broken oaths!"</p>

<p>"Then the powder will burn when next they meet?"</p>

<p>"As long as there's a shot in the locker, Jack. And
Blackbeard's men are ripe for mutiny. Let 'em once
sight Stede Bonnet's topsails and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A gunner's mate broke into this interview with a cat-o'-nine-tails
and flogged Joe Hawkridge forward to
duty. He ducked and fled with a farewell grin at the
nephew of the Secretary of the Council. Now all this
was diverting enough to keep Jack from bemoaning his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
fate, but the other passengers counted the hours one by
one and their hearts began to drum against their ribs.
They scanned the sea and the harbor bar with aching
eyes, for the two days were well-nigh spent and there
was never a sign of the long-boat and the messengers
with the ransom of medicines which should avert the
sentence of death.</p>

<p>Sunrise of the second day brought them no comfort.
The sea was gray and the sky leaden, without the slightest
stir of wind. The drifting vessels rolled in a swell
that heaved as smooth as oil. It was a calm which presaged
violent weather. Against her masts the yards of
the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> banged with a sound like distant
thunder and the idle canvas slatted to the thump of
blocks and the thin wail of chafing cordage.</p>

<p>Captain Jonathan Wellsby was permitted the freedom
of the poop by Blackbeard's sailing-master who
seemed a sober and competent officer. They were seen
to confer earnestly, as though the safety of the ship were
uppermost in their minds. Soon the pirates of the prize
crew were ordered to stow and secure all light sail and
pass extra lashings about the boats and batten the
hatches. They worked slowly, some of them shaking
with fever, nor could kicks and curses and the sting of
the whistling cat make them turn to smartly. The sailing-master
signaled the <i>Revenge</i> to send off more hands
but Blackbeard was either drunk or in one of his crack-brained
moods. With a laugh he pulled a brace of pistols<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
from his sash and blazed away at the <i>Plymouth
Adventure.</i></p>

<p>The two sloops of the pirate squadron had sagged
down to leeward during the night and were trying to
work back to their stations when the dead calm intervened.
Their skippers had sense enough to read the
weather signs and had begun to take in canvas. On
board of the <i>Revenge</i>, however, there was aimless confusion,
the mates making some attempt to prepare the
ship for a heavy blow while Blackbeard defied the elements.
His idea of arousing his men was to try potshots
with his pistols as they crept out on the swaying
spars.</p>

<p>It was quite apparent that the sailing-master was
sorely needed in the <i>Revenge</i>, if order was to be brought
out of this chaos, but he received no orders to quit the
<i>Plymouth Adventure</i>. He was a proper seaman, Ned
Rackham by name, who had deserted from the Royal
Navy, after being flogged and keel-hauled for some trifling
offense. Rumor had it that he was able to enforce
respect from Blackbeard and would stand none of his
infernal nonsense.</p>

<p>"In this autumn season we may catch a storm from
the West Indies, Mr. Rackham," said Captain Wellsby.
"The sea has a greasy look and this heavy ground swell
is a portent."</p>

<p>"The feel of it is in the air, shipmaster. There fell
an evil calm like this come two year ago when I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
wrecked in a ship-of-the-line within sight of Havana.
Four hundred men sank with her."</p>

<p>"If my sailors were not penned in the fo'castle&mdash;&mdash;"
suggested the merchant skipper.</p>

<p>"None o' that," was the stern retort. "This ship is
a prize to Blackbeard and so she stays, and you will sink
or swim with her."</p>

<p>The morning wore on and the two days of grace had
passed for those doleful hostages in the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>.
They beheld the black flag hoisted to the rigging
of the <i>Revenge</i> as a signal of tragic import, but the
bandy-legged monster with the festooned whiskers was
not to disport himself with this wanton butchery. The
sky had closed darkly around the becalmed ships, in
sodden clouds which were suddenly obscured by mist
and rain while the wind sighed in fitful gusts. It steadied
into the southward and swiftly increased in force
until the sea was whipped into foam and scud.</p>

<p>Staunch and well-found, the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>
went reeling off across the spray-swept leagues of water,
showing only her reefed topsails and courses. The two
pirate sloops vanished beyond the curtain of mist.
When last seen, one of them was dismasted and the
other was laboring in grave peril. The <i>Revenge</i> loomed
as a spectral shape while Blackbeard was endeavoring to
get her running free in pursuit of the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>.
But slovenly, reckless seamanship had caught him
unready. His sails were blowing to ribbons, ropes fly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>ing
at loose ends, and it was with great difficulty that the
vessel could be made to mind her tiller.</p>

<p>Already the sea was rising in crested combers which
broke with the noise of thunder and the fury of the wind
was insensate. Slowly the struggling <i>Revenge</i> dropped
astern, yawing wildly, rolling her bulwarks under, splintered
spars dangling from the caps. She was a crippled
ship which would be lucky to see port again. It was to
be inferred that Blackbeard had ceased to cut his mirthful
capers on the poop and that he would have given
bushels of doubloons to regain his sailing-master and
men.</p>

<p>In the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> things were in far better
plight, even with the feeble, short-handed prize crew.
Prudently snugged down in ample time, with extra
hands at the steering tackles, they let her drive. She
would perhaps wear clear of the coast and there was
hope of survival unless the tempest should fairly wrench
her strong timbers asunder.</p>

<p>Lashed to the weather rigging, Captain Jonathan
Wellsby wiped the brine from his eyes and waved his
arm at the helmsman, now to ease her a little, again to
haul up and thus thwart some ravening sea which threatened
to stamp his ship under. Sailing-Master Ned
Rackham was content to let the skipper con his own vessel
in this great emergency.</p>

<p>The mind of Captain Wellsby was very active and he
pondered on something else than winning through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
storm. He had been helpless while under the guns of
the <i>Revenge</i>, with the two sloops in easy call. Now the
situation was vastly different. He had been delivered
out of Blackbeard's clutches. And in the forecastle
were thirty British seamen with hearts of oak, raging to
be loosed with weapons in their hands. Peering into
the gray smother of sea and sky, Captain Jonathan
Wellsby licked his lips hungrily as he said to himself:</p>

<p>"Not now, but if the storm abates and we float
through the night, these lousy picaroons shall dance to
another tune."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE CAPTIVE SEAMEN IN THE FORECASTLE</h3>


<div class='unindent'><big>J</big>ACK COCKRELL was seasick. This was enough
to spoil any adventure. Curled up under a boat,
the spray pelted him and the wild motion of the
ship sloshed him back and forth. He took no interest
even in piracy. Joe Hawkridge, tough as whip-cord
and seasoned to all kinds of weather, came clawing his
way aft while the water streamed from his thin shirt and
ragged breeches. The pirates of the prize crew had
sought shelter wherever they could find it. The waist
of the ship was flooded with breaking seas. A few of
the larboard watch were huddled forward, close to the
lofty forecastle where they were stationed as sentries
over the imprisoned sailors of the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>.</div>

<p>The commotion of the wind shrieking in the rigging
and the horrid crash of the toppling combers were
enough to convince a landlubber that the vessel was
doomed to founder. But Joe Hawkridge clapped
young Jack an affectionate clout on the ear and bawled
at him:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"For his work he's never loth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' a-pleasurin' he'll go,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Tho' certain sure to be popt off;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><i>Yo, ho, with the rum below!</i>"</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></div>

<p>Jack managed to fetch a sickly smile of greeting, but
had nothing to say. Joe snuggled down beside him and
explained:</p>

<p>"I wouldn't dare sing that song if Blackbeard's bullies
could hear me. 'Tis known as Stede Bonnet's ditty,
for a fight or a frolic."</p>

<p>"By Harry, they can roll it out. My blood tingled
when they chorused it through Charles Town," said
Jack, with signs of animation and a sparkle in his eye.
"Tell me truly, Joe. What about this pirate sailing-master,
Ned Rackham? He seems a different sort from
your other drunken wretches. He is more like one of
Captain Bonnet's choosing."</p>

<p>"Gulled you, has he?" cried Joe. "I was afeard of
that. And he's getting on the blind side of your skipper.
This Cap'n Jonathan Wellsby is brave enough
and a rare seaman, but he ne'er dealt with a smooth
rogue like Ned Rackham. He stays sober to plot for
his own advantage. He will serve Blackbeard only till
he can trip him by the heels. Now listen well, Jack, seasick
though ye be. You will have to warn your skipper,
Captain Wellsby."</p>

<p>"Warn him of what? My poor head is so addled
that I can fathom no plots. How can Ned Rackham
do us mischief while this infernal gale blows? He toils
with might and main for the safety of the ship."</p>

<p>"Yes, you dunce, and let a lull come," scornfully exclaimed
the boyish pirate. "What then? A fine ship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
this, and well gunned. She would make a smackin'
cruiser for Ned Rackham, eh? He hoists the Jolly
Roger on his own account and laughs at Blackbeard."</p>

<p>"Take our ship for his own?" faltered Jack, his wits
confused. "I never thought of that. Why, that means
getting rid of us, of the passengers and crew."</p>

<p>Joe passed a hand across his throat with a grimace
that said more than words.</p>

<p>"He has the ship's company disarmed and helpless,
Jack. And pirates a-plenty to work her till he recruits
a stronger force. All hands of 'em have a surfeit of
Blackbeard's bloody whims an' didoes."</p>

<p>"And Captain Wellsby will be caught off his guard?"
said Jack, shivering at the aspect of this new terror.</p>

<p>"Can he do aught to prevent, unless he is bold enough
to forestall it?" answered the shrewd young sea
waif. "Better die fighting than be slain like squealin'
rats."</p>

<p>"Recapture the ship ere Ned Rackham casts the
dice," said Jack. "But it means playing the hazard in
the midst of this storm. How can it be done? A forlorn
venture. It can but fail."</p>

<p>"You are as good as dead if you don't," was Joe's
sensible verdict.</p>

<p>Jack Cockrell forgot his wretched qualms of mind
and body. The trumpet call of duty invigorated him.
He was no longer a useless lump. The color returned
to his cheek as he crawled from under the boat and shak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>ily
hauled himself to his feet. Joe Hawkridge nodded
approval and exhorted:</p>

<p>"A stiff upper lip, my gallant young gentleman.
Steady she goes, an' not too hasty. Ned Rackham is
as sharp as a whetted sword. Ware ye, boy, lest he pick
up the scent. Fetch me word, here, beneath this jolly-boat."</p>

<p>Jack stole away, staggering along the high poop deck
until he could cling to the life-line stretched along the
roof of the great cabin. There he slumped down and
feigned helplessness, banged against the bulwark as a
dripping heap of misery or kicked aside by the pirates
of the watch as they were relieved at the steering tackles.
From half-closed eyes he watched Ned Rackham, a
vigilant, dominant figure in a tarred jacket and quilted
breeches and long sea-boots. Now and again he cupped
his hands and yelled in the ear of Captain Wellsby
whose beard was gray with brine.</p>

<p>Jack saw that it was hopeless to get a private word
with the skipper on deck. The clamor of the storm was
too deafening. The one chance was to intercept him in
the cabin when he went below for food and drink. Jack
dragged himself to the after hatchway which was
shoved open a trifle to admit air, and squeezed himself
through. Before he tumbled down the steep staircase he
turned to glance at Captain Wellsby. Unseen by Ned
Rackham, the boy raised his hand in a furtive, beckoning
gesture.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>The pirates had taken the main room of the after-house
for their own use, driving the passengers and
ship's officers into the small cabins or staterooms. The
air was foul below, reeking of the bilges, and the main
room was incredibly filthy. The pirates ate from dirty
dishes, they had scattered food about, and they kicked
off their boots to sleep on the floor like pigs in a
sty.</p>

<p>Several of them were seated at the long table, bottle
and mug in hand, and the gloomy place was poorly
lighted by a swinging whale-oil lamp. Jack Cockrell
crept unnoticed into a corner and was giddy and almost
helpless with nausea. It seemed ages before Captain
Wellsby's legs appeared in the hatchway and he came
down into the cabin, bringing a shower of spray with
him. His kindly face was haggard and sad and he tottered
from sheer weariness. Passing through to his own
room, a scurvy pirate hurled refuse food at him, with a
silly laugh, and others insulted him with the foulest epithets.</p>

<p>He paid them no heed and they returned to their own
amusements. Jack Cockrell aroused himself to stumble
after the skipper who halted to grasp the lad by the
shoulder and shove him headlong into the little room.
The door was quickly bolted behind them. A lurch of
the vessel flung Jack into the bunk but he managed to
sit up, holding his head in his hands, while he feebly
implored:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you note me wave my hand, sir, when I came
below?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I followed as soon as I could," answered
the master of the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>. "There was
the hint of secrecy in your signal, Jack. What's in the
wind?"</p>

<p>"I am the only passenger to win the confidence of
one of Blackbeard's crew," explained the lad. "This
Joe Hawkridge is true to us, I'll swear it. He is a
pressed man, hating his masters. He bids me tell you
that Ned Rackham will seize the ship for his own as soon
as ever the wind goes down."</p>

<p>"Um-m, is he as bold as that?" grunted the skipper,
rubbing his nose with an air of rueful surprise. "No
honor among thieves, Jack. I thought him loyal to
Blackbeard. I have considered attempting something
of my own when the weather permits but this news
quickens me. This young imp o' Satan that ye call Joe,&mdash;he
will side with us in a pinch?"</p>

<p>"Aye, sir. And he knows this Ned Rackham well.
There has been talk among the pirates of rising against
Blackbeard to follow the fortunes of Sailing-Master
Rackham. Here is the ship, as Joe says."</p>

<p>"It has a plausible sound," said Captain Wellsby.
"My intention was to wait, but I shall have to strike
first."</p>

<p>"Can we fight in this storm, sir, even if we manage to
release our sailors?" asked Jack, very dismally.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not what we can, but what we must do," growled
the stubborn British mariner. "The shame of striking
my colors rankles like a wound. God helping me, we
shall wipe out that stain if we drown in a sinking ship.
I talk to you as a man, Master Cockrell, for such you
have proven yourself. And who else is there to serve
me in this adventure?"</p>

<p>"To set our sailors free, you mean, sir?" eagerly exclaimed
Jack. "I took thought of that. There is nobody
but me, neither your mates nor the passengers,
who can pass among the pirates without suspicion. The
knaves have humored me, hearing the tale of the pirate
I knocked on the head and my braggart remark to
Blackbeard. They have seen me about the decks with
Joe Hawkridge as my boon comrade. 'Tis their fancy
that I am likely to enlist."</p>

<p>"Well said, Jack," was the skipper's compliment.
"Yes, you might make your way for'ard without interference,&mdash;but
the fo'castle hatches are stoutly guarded.
Again, should my brave fellows find exit, they are weaponless,
unready. Moreover, they have been crammed
in that dark hole, drenched by the sea, cruelly bruised
by the tossing of the ship, and weakened for lack of food
and air."</p>

<p>"Granted, sir," sighed Jack. "But if some message
could be smuggled in to forewarn them of the enterprise,&mdash;would
that brace 'em to the assault?"</p>

<p>"Will ye try it, Jack?" asked the skipper, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
note of appeal in his hearty voice. "I know not where
else to turn. You take your life in your hands but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The shipmaster broke off with a grim smile. It was
absurd to prate of life or death in such a strait as this.
The boy reflected before he said:</p>

<p>"If&mdash;if I fail, sir, Joe Hawkridge will try to pass a
message in to the men. You can depend on 't."</p>

<p>"A last resort, Jack. You vouch for him but I trust
you far sooner. He has kept sorry company."</p>

<p>"When is the best hour, Captain Wellsby?"</p>

<p>"Just before nightfall when the watches will be
changing. I dare not delay it longer than that. In
darkness, my lads will be unable to find the foe and
strike hard and quick. Nor can they rush to lay hold
of the only weapons in their reach,&mdash;the pikes in the
racks beside the masts. Not a pistol or cutlass amongst
'em, and they must fight with these wicked dogs of pirates
who think naught of killing men."</p>

<p>"Let your lusty sailors once get clear, sir," stoutly
declared Jack Cockrell, "and they will play a merry
game with those long pikes. Then I am to slip the
message written by your hand on a bit of paper?"</p>

<p>"That's it! I will command them to pound against
the scuttle, three raps, for a signal of response, and you
must listen for it. Then it is for them to stand ready,
on the chance that you can slip the bar of the hatch or
the bolts on the door."</p>

<p>"But if they have to come out singly, sir, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
sentries are ready-witted, why, your men may be cut
down or pistoled in their tracks."</p>

<p>"I am so aware," said Captain Wellsby, his honest
features glum, "but we cannot change the odds."</p>

<p>He found an ink-horn and quill and laboriously wrote
a few lines on a leaf torn from the back of a sea-stained
log-book. Jack tucked it carefully away and thus they
parted company, perhaps to meet no more in life.
Through the waning afternoon, Jack stowed himself on
deck and held long converse with Joe Hawkridge when
they met between the keel-chocks of the jolly-boat. Because
he shared not the skipper's feeling of distrust,
Jack sought the active aid of his chum of a pirate lad.
It was agreed that they should endeavor to reach the
forecastle together when the ship's bell tolled the hour
of beginning the first night watch.</p>

<p>Joe hoped he might decoy or divert the sentries. If
not, he had another scheme or two. A gunner's mate of
the prize crew had sent him to overhaul the lashings of
the battery of nine-pounders which were ranged along
the waist. With several other hands Joe had made all
secure, because the guns were apt to get adrift in such
weather as this and plunge to and fro across the deck
like maddened beasts. Now Joe Hawkridge had lingered,
on pretext of making sure that one forward gun
could be fired, if needs be, as a distress signal should the
ship open her seams or strike upon a shoal.</p>

<p>He had satisfied himself that the tompion, or wooden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
plug which sealed the muzzle was tight, and that no
water had leaked through the wrapping of tarred canvas
which protected the touch-hole. Before replacing them,
he had made two or three trips to the deck-house amidships
in which was the carpenter's room. Each time he
tucked inside his shirt as many forged iron spikes, bolts,
and what not as he could safely carry.</p>

<p>Unobserved, he shoved this junk down the throat of
the nine-pounder and wadded it fast with handfuls of
oakum. He worked coolly, without haste, as agile as a
monkey when the ship careened and the sea spurted
through the cracks of the gun-ports. Well pleased with
his task, he said to himself, with that grin which no peril
could obliterate:</p>

<p>"God alone knows how I can strike fire to a match
and keep it alight, but the sky shows signs of easier
weather."</p>

<p>The fury of the storm had, indeed, diminished. It
might be a respite before the wind hauled into another
quarter and renewed its ferocious violence, but the air
was no longer thick with the whirling smother of foam
and spray and the straining topmasts had ceased to bend
like whips. The ship was gallantly easing herself of the
waves which broke aboard and the rearing billows astern
were not threatening to stamp her under.</p>

<p>It lacked almost an hour of nightfall when Jack Cockrell
crept along the poop and halted to lean against the
timbered railing by the mizzen shrouds. All he could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
think of was that Ned Rackham might seize upon this
sudden abatement of the gale to hasten his own wicked
conspiracy and so ruin the plan to restore the <i>Plymouth
Adventure</i> to her own lawful company. This menace
had occurred to Captain Jonathan Wellsby who stood
tense and rigid at the sailing-master's elbow, watching
him from the tail of his eye.</p>

<p>Relief o'erspread the skipper's worn features when he
espied Jack Cockrell who stood as if waiting for orders.
A nod, a meaning glance, and they understood each
other. Striving to appear unconcerned, Jack moved toward
the forward part of the ship. He was aquiver
with excitement, and his breath was quick and small, but
the sense of fear had left him. Captain Wellsby had
called him a man and, by God's sweet grace, he would so
acquit himself.</p>

<p>The pirates were swarming out of the cabin to taste
the clean air and limber their cramped muscles. The
ship still wallowed as she ran before the wind and it was
breakneck work to clamber about. From the topsail
yards fluttered mere ribbons of canvas where the reefed
sails had bellied. Ned Rackham shouted for the watch
to lay aloft and cut the remnants clear and bend new
cloths to keep her from broaching to.</p>

<p>Jack Cockrell's heart leaped for joy. At least a
dozen of the most active pirates would have to obey this
order. This would remove them from the deck for a
precious interval of time. He slouched aimlessly nearer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the forecastle, stretching his neck to gaze up at the pirates
as they footed the ratlines and squirmed over the
clumsy tops. Joe Hawkridge joined him, as if by
chance, and they wandered to the lee side of the forecastle.
There they were screened from the sight of the
sentries.</p>

<p>The wooden shutters of the little windows had been
spiked fast on the outside and Jack was at his wits' end
to find by what means he might slip the fateful message
to the captive seamen. He dared not climb upon the
roof and seek for a crack in a hatchway. This would
make him too conspicuous.</p>

<p>Cautiously he stole around the massive structure and
was all but washed overboard when he gained the windward
side where the water broke in hissing cataracts.
So great had been its force during the height of the
storm, that one of the shutters had been splintered and
almost crushed in. Clutching the bit of paper which
was tightly rolled and wrapped in a square of oiled
linen, Jack pushed it through a ragged crevice in the
shutter.</p>

<p>It was gravely doubtful whether the men would discover
the message in the gloom of their prison. It
might fall to the floor and be trampled unperceived.
And yet Jack Cockrell could not make himself believe
that deliverance would be thwarted. He said a prayer
and waited with his ear against the wall of the forecastle.
There he leaned through an agonized eternity as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
slow moments passed. It was like the ordeal of a condemned
man who hopes that a blessed reprieve may
save him, in the last hour, from the black cap and the
noose.</p>

<p>Up aloft the pirate seamen were slashing the torn
canvas with their dirks and casting loose the gaskets.
Presently they began to come down to the deck, one by
one. Some whispered word must have passed amongst
them, because they drifted aft as by a common impulse
although it was not yet the hour to change the watch.
Their gunner's mate, a gigantic mulatto with a broken
nose, went to the poop when Ned Rackham crooked his
finger and these two stood aside, beyond earshot of Captain
Wellsby, while they conferred with heads together.</p>

<p>"They will strike first," Jack whispered to himself.</p>

<p>The misty daylight had not darkened. The decks
were not yet dusky with the shadows which Jack had
hoped might enable him to approach the forecastle door
in his brave endeavor to unbar it. The plans were all
awry. Tears filled his eyes. And then there came to his
ear a muffled knock against the other side of the forecastle
planking.</p>

<p>Once, twice, thrice! The signal was unmistakable.
A little interval and it was repeated.</p>

<p>Softly the trembling lad tiptoed to the corner of the
forecastle house and peered around it to look for the
sentries. Two of them had moved a few yards away to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
join a group which gazed aft as if expecting a summons
from Ned Rackham on the poop. The third sentry
leaned against the forecastle door, a cutlass at his belt.
He was a long, bony man with a face as yellow as parchment
from the Spanish fever and it was plain to read
that there was no great strength in him.</p>

<p>Faithful Joe Hawkridge sat astride the breech of the
nine-pounder at which he had been so busily engaged
earlier in the afternoon. He appeared to be an idler
who merely looked on but he was watching every motion,
and that hard, canny face of his had, for once, forgot
to grin. Releasing a three-foot handspike from its
lashing beside the gun-carriage, he awaited the next roll
of the deck and deftly kicked this handy weapon. It
slid toward the forecastle and Jack Cockrell stopped it
with his foot.</p>

<p>There was no time for hesitation. Snatching up the
iron-shod handspike, Jack rushed straight at the forecastle
door. Just then the ship lurched far down and
he was shot headlong, like falling off the roof of a house.
He had the momentum of a battering-ram. The sentry
yelled and drew his cutlass with a swiftness amazing in
a sick man. His footing was unsteady or Jack would
have spitted himself on the point of the blade. As he
went crashing full-tilt into the man the impact was
terrific. They went to the deck together and the handspike
spun out of Jack's grasp. There was no need to
swing it on this luckless pirate for his bald head smote a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
plank with a thump which must have cracked it like an
egg.</p>

<p>Not even pausing to dart after the cutlass which had
clattered from the lifeless fingers, Jack spun on his heel
and wrenched at the heavy bar across the forecastle door
and felt it slide from the fastenings. He tugged it clear
and swung himself up to the roof to draw the bolts which
secured the hatch. Rusted in their sockets, they resisted
him but he spied a pulley-block within reach and used it
as a hammer.</p>

<p>All this was a matter of seconds only. The pirates
grouped amidships had been waiting for Ned Rackham's
word from aft and they were muddled by this sudden
shift of action. The other sentries stared in foolish
astonishment. The brief delay was enough to let Jack
Cockrell free the hatch. While he toiled furiously, several
pistols and a musket were snapped at him but the
flint sparked on damp powder in the pans and only one
ball whistled by his head.</p>

<p>Out of the forecastle hatchway and through the door,
the enraged sailors of the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> came
rocketing like an explosion. They stumbled over each
other, emerging head or feet first, blinking like owls in
the daylight but with vision good enough to serve their
purpose. Their goal was the nearest stand of boarding-pikes
at the foot of the mainmast.</p>

<p>But as they came surging on deck, they were not
empty-handed. In the forecastle was a bricked oven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
for warmth in winter and for cooking kettles of soup.
This they had torn to pieces and every man sallied forth
with a square, flat brick in each hand and more inside
his shirt. Those who were first to gain the deck pelted
the nearest pirates with these ugly missiles. The air was
full of hurtling bricks and the earliest casualty was a
stout buccaneer who stopped one with his stomach.</p>

<p>Driven back in yelling confusion, the pirates found
their firearms almost useless, so drenched had the whole
ship been by the battering seas, but they were accustomed
to fighting it out with the cold steel and they were
by no means a panicky mob. The fusillade of bricks
held them long enough for the merchant sailors to escape
from the forecastle and this was an advantage more
precious than Captain Wellsby had hoped for.</p>

<p>What the pirates required was a leader to rally <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'than'">them</ins>
for attack. Quicker than it takes to tell it, Ned Rackham
had raced along the poop and leaped to the waist at
peril of breaking his neck. Agile, quick-witted, he
bounded into the thick of it, cutlass in hand, while he
shouted:</p>

<p>"At 'em, lads! And give the dogs no quarter!"</p>

<p>With hoarse outcry, his gallows-birds mustered compactly
while those who had been in the cabin came
scampering to join them. Curiously enough, Captain
Jonathan Wellsby had been forgotten. He was left
alone to handle the ship while the pirate helmsmen stood
by the great tiller. To forsake it meant to let the vessel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
run wild and perhaps turn turtle in the swollen seas.
And so the doughty skipper was, for the time, a
looker-on.</p>

<p>And now with Ned Rackham in the van, it seemed
that the British sailors were in a parlous plight and that
their sortie must fail. Craftily the pirates man&#339;uvered
to drive them back into the forecastle and there to
butcher them like sheep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>RELEASING A FEARFUL WEAPON</h3>


<div class='unindent'><big>J</big>ACK COCKRELL sprawled flat upon the
forecastle roof and knew not what to do. He
could lay hands on nothing to serve as a
weapon and he bade fair to be trapped like the
sailors whose cause he had joined. With a feeling
of despair he let his gaze rove to the scrawny
figure of Joe Hawkridge who still bestrode the
nine-pounder and took no part in the fray. But Joe
had no comfort for him, as a gesture conveyed. It had
been Joe's wild scheme to obtain the help of Jack and
Captain Wellsby, at the least, and so cast loose the gun
and slew it around to rake the deck and mow the pirates
down. But the men were lacking for this heavy task,
and the sailors of the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> were too intent
on fighting against fearful odds to pay heed to Joe
Hawkridge's appeals. He had even skulked into the
galley and was ready with a little iron pot filled with
live coals which was hidden under a bit of tarpaulin.</div>

<p>Ned Rackham was a young man and powerful, with
a long reach and a skilled blade. He fairly hewed his
way into the ruck of the dauntless sailors who had no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
more bricks to hurl. Several pirates were disabled, with
broken arms or bloody crowns, but the others crowded
forward, grunting as they slashed and stabbed, and well
aware that Ned Rackham would cut the laggards down
should he detect them.</p>

<p>At the moment when there seemed no chance of salvation
for the crew of the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>, Joe
Hawkridge leaped from the gun and beckoned Jack.
The grin was restored to the homely, freckled visage
and the salt water gamin danced in jubilant excitement.
Down from the forecastle roof tumbled Jack Cockrell
and went sliding across the deck, heels over head, to
fetch up in the scupper. Joe hauled him by the leg,
close to the wooden carriage of the gun, and swiftly told
him what was to be done.</p>

<p>Obediently Jack began to loose the knots which secured
the rope tackles but it was a slow task. The wet
had made the hemp as hard as iron and he lacked a marlinspike.
Joe dodged around the gun, saw the difficulty
and sawed through one rope after another, all but the
last strand or two. Then the lads tailed on to the
breeching hawsers, which held the carriage from sliding
on its iron rollers, and eased the strain as well as they
could.</p>

<p>The ponderous mass was almost free to plunge across
the deck. Joe sweated and braced his feet against a
ring-bolt while Jack Cockrell found a cleat. Ned Rackham's
men were moving forward, cut and thrust, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the sailors grappled with them bare-handed and battled
grimly like mastiffs.</p>

<p>"The next time she rolls!" panted Joe Hawkridge as
the hawser ripped the skin from his palms.</p>

<p>"Aye, make ready to cut," muttered Jack.</p>

<p>The ship heaved herself high and then listed far down
to starboard. Joe slashed at the last strands of the
tackles and yelled to Jack to let go the hawser. Instead
of discharging the nine-pounder, they were employing
the piece itself, and the carriage of oak and iron, as a
terrible missile. The moment of launching it was
shrewdly chosen. The pirates, still in compact formation
as led by Ned Rackham, were directly abreast of
this forward gun of the main deck battery. The deck
inclined at a steep and giddy pitch. With a grinding
roar the gun rolled from its station. It gathered impetus
and lunged across the ship as an instrument of fell
destruction. It was more to be feared than an assault
of armed men.</p>

<p>The warning rumble of the iron wheels as they furrowed
the planking was heard by the pirates. They
turned from their game of butchery and stood frozen in
their tracks for a frightened instant. Then they tried to
flee in all directions. Their tarry pigtails fairly stood on
end. Well they knew what it meant to have a gun break
adrift in a heavy sea. Two or three who had been badly
hurt were unable to move fast enough. The gun
crunched over them and then seemed to pursue a limp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>ing
pirate, veering to overtake him as he fled. He was
tossed against the bulwark like a bundle of bloody
rags.</p>

<p>The gun crashed into the stout timbers of the ship's
side and they were splintered like match-wood. It rebounded
as the deck sloped sharply in the next wallowing
roll, and now this frenzied monster of wood and iron
seemed fairly to run amuck. It was inspired with a
sinister intelligence, resolved to wreak all the damage
possible. The pinnace, the water barrels, the coamings
of the cargo hatches, were smashed to fragments as the
gun turned this way and that and went plunging in
search of victims.</p>


<p>Left to themselves, the seamen of the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>
would have risked their lives to cast ropes about
the gun and moor it fast. But now they were quick to
see that the tide had been turned in their favor. The
pirates were demoralized. Some were in the rigging,
others atop the bulwarks, and only the readiest and
boldest, with Ned Rackham in the lead, had an eye to
the task in hand, which was to regain possession of the
ship.</p>

<p>And now the boatswain of the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>,
a rosy giant of a man from South Devon, shouted to his
comrades to follow him. They delayed until the runaway
cannon crashed into another gun, and then they
broke like sprinters from the mark and sped straight for
the mainmast, seeking the rack of boarding-pikes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
They ran nimbly, as men used to swaying decks, and
compassed the distance in a few strides.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="600" height="458" alt="THE BRAWN OF THESE LADS MADE THE PIKE A MATCH FOR A PIRATE&#39;S CUTLASS" title="THE BRAWN OF THESE LADS MADE THE PIKE A MATCH FOR A PIRATE&#39;S CUTLASS" />
<span class="caption">THE BRAWN OF THESE LADS MADE THE PIKE A MATCH FOR A PIRATE&#39;S CUTLASS</span>
</div>

<p>Ned Rackham perceived their purpose and tried to
intercept but his few staunch followers moved warily,
expecting to see that insensate monster of a gun bear
down upon them. The swiftest of the merchant sailors
laid hands on the pikes and whirled to cover their shipmates,
until all hands could be armed. Then the gun
came roaring down at them but they ducked behind the
mast or stepped watchfully aside. Men condemned to
death are not apt to lose their wits in the face of one
more peril.</p>

<p>These pikes were ashen shafts with long steel points
and the merchant seamen had been trained to use them.
And the brawn of these lads made the pike a match for
a pirate's cutlass. Ned Rackham bounded forward to
swing at the broad, deep-chested boatswain. A wondrous
pair of antagonists they were, in the prime of
their youth and vigor. The pirate's cutlass bit clean
through the pike shaft as the boatswain parried the blow
but the apple-cheeked Devonshire man closed in and
wrapped his arms around his foe. They went to the
deck clutching for each other's throats and the fight
trampled over them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Joe Hawkridge and Jack Cockrell, unwilling
to twiddle their thumbs, had rushed aft as fast
as their legs could carry them. It was a mutual impulse,
to release such of the men passengers as might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
have a stomach for fighting and also the ship's officers.
Into the doorway which led from the waist, the two lads
dived and scurried through the main cabin now clear of
pirates. Locked doors they smashed with a broadaxe
found in the small-arms chest and so entered all the
rooms.</p>

<p>The women passengers were almost dead with suffering,
what with the turbulence of the storm and the wild
riot on deck. The lads pitied them but had no time to
console. Several of the men, merchants and planters of
some physical hardihood, begged for weapons and Joe
Hawkridge bade them help themselves from the spare
arms which the pirates had left in the great cabin. In
another little room the boys found the mates, steward,
surgeon, and gunner of the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> and
you may be sure that they came boiling out with a raging
thirst for strife.</p>

<p>"Harkee, Jack," said Joe before they climbed to the
poop deck, "if the pirates are driven aft, as I expect,
they will make a last stand in this cabin house which is
like a fort. These 'fenseless women must be hidden safe
from harm. Do you coax 'em into the lazarette."</p>

<p>This was a room on the deck below, in the very stern
of the ship where were kept the extra sails and coils of
rope and various stores. It was the surest shelter against
harm in such stress as this. Alas, Jack's persuasions
were vain. The frantic women were in no humor to
listen, and so the lads bundled them through the hatch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
as gently as possible and for company gave them such
male passengers as lacked strength or courage to join
the battle.</p>

<p>While they were thus engaged, two pirates came flying
down the ladder from the poop deck into the main
cabin. They revolved like windmills in a jumble of
arms and legs. Close behind them, in a manner more
orderly came Captain Jonathan Wellsby who had tossed
the one and tremendously booted the other. They were
the helmsmen whom he had replaced with his own officers
at the steering tackles, while his first mate had been
left in charge of handling the ship.</p>

<p>The skipper was now free to follow his own desires
and he fell upon those two stunned pirates in the cabin
and trussed them tight with bits of rope. Then he reloaded
with dry powder all the pistols he could find and
made a walking <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'arsensal'">arsenal</ins> of himself. The two lads who
now joined him needed no word of command. At his
heels they made for the main deck and the shout which
arose from those British sailors, so sorely beset, was
mightily heartening.</p>

<p>Blazing away with his pistols, the skipper cleared a
path for himself, the pirates being taken aback when
they were attacked in the rear. And they were leaderless,
for Ned Rackham had been dragged aside with the
marks of the boatswain's fingers on his throat and a
sheath-knife buried in his side. He was alive but nobody
paid heed to his groans.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>With the skipper in the thick of it, there was no danger
of being penned in the forecastle again. The pirates
were crowded aft, step by step, before the play of those
wicked boarding-pikes. It would be hard to match a
sea fight like this, amid the spray and the washing seas,
on a deck that tipsily danced and staggered, with a truant
gun smashing a good ship to bits and the wounded
screaming as they saw this horror thundering at them.
Captain Wellsby's men were at pains to drag their helpless
comrades to safety but the pirates were too callous
and too hard pressed to care for aught save their own
worthless skins. They fought like wolves but they
lacked the gristle and endurance of the stalwart sailors.
Wheezing for breath, they ceased to curse and reeled
back in silence while the sailors huzzaed and seemed to
wax the lustier.</p>

<p>As was bound to happen, the stubborn retreat broke
into a rout. It was every man for himself and the devil
take the hindmost. The pirates fled for the after cabin-house,
there to take cover behind the timbered walls and
use the small port-holes for musketry fire. Thus they
could find respite and it would be immensely difficult to
dislodge them.</p>

<p>The first mate of the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> and his
own two helmsmen saw what was taking place and they
were of no mind to be cut off at the stern of the ship.
They footed it along the poop and the cabin roof as the
pirates were scampering inside and so gained the waist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and were with their comrades. The tiller deserted, the
vessel careened into the trough of the sea with a portentous
creaking of spars and rending of canvas.</p>

<p>The mainmast had been dealt more than one splintering
blow by the fugitive gun. This sudden strain, of a
ship broached to and hurled almost on her beam ends,
was too much for the damaged mast. It broke short off,
a few feet above the deck, and the ragged butt ripped
the planks asunder as it was dragged overside by the
weight of the towering fabric of yards and canvas. One
merciful circumstance befell, for the tangle of shrouds
and sheets and halliards ensnared the ramping monster
of a cannon and overturned it. Caught in this manner,
the gun was dragged to the broken bulwark and there
it was held with the battered carriage in air.</p>

<p>The mainmast was floating alongside the ship which
it belabored with thumps that jarred the hull. It was
likely to stave in the skin of the vessel and Captain
Wellsby shouted to his men to hack at the trailing cordage
and send the mast clear before it did a fatal injury.
A dozen men risked drowning at this task while the
others guarded the after cabin lest the pirates attempt a
sally. These besieged rogues were given an interval in
which to muster their force, organize a defense, and
break into the magazine for muskets and powder and
ball.</p>

<p>Now Captain Wellsby was no dullard and he purposed
to make short work of these vile pirates. Other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>wise
his crippled ship might not survive the wind and
weather. He conferred with his gunner who had bethought
himself, by force of habit, to fetch from aft his
powder-horn and several yards of match, or twisted tow,
which were wrapped around his body, beneath the tarred
jerkin.</p>

<p>"It grieves me sore to wreck yonder goodly cabin
house," said the skipper in his beard, "but, by Judas,
we'll blow 'em out of it. Haul and belay your pieces,
Master Gunner, and let 'em have a salvo of round shot."</p>

<p>Reckless of the musket balls which began to fly among
them, the sailors jumped for their stations at the guns.
First they set aright that capsized nine-pounder which
had wreaked so much mischief and found that it could
be discharged, despite the broken carriage. Joe Hawkridge
and Jack Cockrell blithely aided to swing and secure
it with emergency tackles and Joe exclaimed, with
a chuckle:</p>

<p>"This dose is enough to surprise Blackbeard hisself.
'Tis an ironmonger's shop I rammed down its throat."</p>

<p>The gun was laid on the largest cabin port-hole just
as it framed the ugly face of a pirate with a musket
while another peered over his shoulder. Joe shook the
powder-horn into the touch-hole and the gunner was
ready with the match which he had lighted with his own
flint and steel. Boom, and the gun recoiled in a veil of
smoke. Through the cabin port-hole flew a deadly
shower of spikes and bolts while the framework around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
it was shattered to bits. It was a most unhealthy place
for pirates. They forsook it instantly. And the musketry
fire slackened elsewhere. It was to be inferred
that there was painful consternation in the cabin.</p>

<p>With boisterous mirth, the sailors deftly turned other
guns to bear and were careful not to let them get adrift.
The muzzles had been well stopped against wetting by
the sea and with a little dry powder for the priming,
most of them could be served. They could not be reloaded
for dearth of ammunition but Captain Wellsby
felt confident that one round would suffice.</p>

<p>Methodically the gun-crews aimed and fired one gun
after another, watching the chance between the seas that
broke aboard. The solid round shot, at short range,
ripped through the cabin walls and bulkheads and buried
themselves in the frames and timbers of the ship's stern.
A good gunner was never so happy as when he saw the
white splinters fly in showers and these zealous sailormen
forgot they were knocking their own ship to pieces.
They were on the target, and this was good enough.</p>

<p>The beleaguered pirates made no more pretense of
firing muskets or defying the crew to dig them out.
Their fort was an untenable position. At this sport of
playing bowls with round shot they were bound to lose.
Captain Wellsby sighted the last gun himself. It was
a bronze culverin of large bore, taken as a trophy from
the stranded wreck of a Spanish galleon. With a tremendous
blast this formidable cannon spat out a double-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>shotted
load and the supports of the cabin roof were torn
asunder. The tottering beams collapsed. Half the
structure fell in.</p>

<p>It was the signal for the sailors of the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>
to charge aft and finish the business. They
found pirates crawling from under the wreckage. It
was like a demolished ant-heap. In the smaller cabins
and other rooms far aft, which were more or less intact,
some of the rascals showed fight but they were remorselessly
prodded out with pikes and those unwounded were
hustled forward to be thrown into the forecastle. It
was difficult to restrain the seamen from dealing them
the death they deserved but Captain Wellsby was no
sea-butcher and he hoped to turn them over to the
colonial authorities to be hanged with due ceremony.</p>

<p>The badly hurt were laid in the forecastle bunks
where the ship's surgeon washed and bandaged them
after he had cared for the injured men of his own crew.
Ned Rackham was still alive, conscious and defiant, surviving
a wound which would have been mortal in most
cases. Whether he lived or died was a matter of small
concern to Captain Wellsby but he ordered the surgeon
to nurse him with special care.</p>

<p>The dead pirates were flung overboard but the bodies
of seven brave British seamen were wrapped in sailcloth
to be committed to the deep on the morrow, with a
round shot at their feet and a prayer to speed their
souls. There were men enough to work the ship but she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
was in a situation indescribably forlorn. It was possible
to patch and shore the cabin house and make a refuge,
even to find place for the wretched women who were
lifted unharmed out of the lazarette. But the stout ship,
her mainmast gone by the board, the deck ravaged by
that infernal catapult of an errant gun, the hull pounded
by the floating wreckage of spars, would achieve a miracle
should she see port again.</p>

<p>The combat with the pirates and their overthrow had
been waged in the last hour before the gray night closed
over a somber sea. God's mercy had caused the wind
to fall and the waves to diminish in size else the ship
would have gone to the bottom ere dawn. Much water
had washed down into the hold through the broken
cargo hatch and the gaps where the runaway gun had
torn other fittings away. The carpenter sounded the
well and solemnly stared at the wetted rod by the flicker
of his horn lantern. The ship was settling. It was his
doleful surmise that she leaked where the pounding
spars overside had started the butts. It was man the
pumps to keep the old hooker afloat and Captain
Wellsby ordered his weary men to sway at the brakes,
watch and watch.</p>

<p>Joe Hawkridge and Jack Cockrell, more fit for duty
than the others, put their backs into it right heartily
while the sailors droned to the cadence of the pump a
sentimental ditty which ran on for any number of verses
and began in this wise:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>"As, lately I traveled toward Gravesend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I heard a fair Damosel a Sea-man commend:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And as in a Tilt-boat we passed along,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In praise of brave Sea-men she sung this new Song,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;"><i>Come Tradesman or Marchant, whoever he be,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;"><i>There's none but a Sea-man shall marry with me!</i>"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Thus they labored all the night through, men near
dead with fatigue whose hard fate it was to contend now
with pirates and again with the hostile ocean. The
skipper managed to stay the foremast and to bend steering
sails so that the ship was brought into the wind
where her motion was easier. The sky cleared before
daybreak and the rosy horizon proclaimed a fair sunrise.
How far and in what direction the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>
had been blown by the storm was largely guesswork.
By means of dead reckoning and the compass and cross-staff,
Captain Wellsby hoped to work out a position but
meanwhile he scanned the sea with a sense of brooding
anxiety.</p>

<p>Instead of praying for plenty of sea room, he now
hoped with all his heart that the vessel had been set in
toward the coast. She was sinking under his feet and
would not live through the day. It was useless to toil
at the pumps or to strive at mending the shattered upperworks.
The men turned to the task of quitting the
ship, and of saving the souls on board. It was a pitiful
extremity and yet they displayed a dogged, unshaken
fidelity. Only one boat had escaped destruction. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
pinnace had been staved in by the thunderbolt of a gun
and the yawl, stowed upon the cabin roof, was wrecked
by round shot. The small jolly-boat would hold the
women passengers and the wounded sailors, with the
hands required to tend oars and sail.</p>

<p>Nothing remained but to try to knock together one
or more rafts. Captain Wellsby discussed it with his
officers and it was agreed that the able-bodied pirates
should be left to build a raft for themselves, taking their
own wounded with them. This was more mercy than
they had any right to expect. The strapping young
Devonshire boatswain, with his head tied up, was for
leaving the blackguards to drown in the forecastle but
the shipmaster was too humane a man for that.</p>

<p>It was drawing toward noon when the first mate
descried land to the westward, a bit of low coast almost
level with the sea. In the light air the sluggish ship
moved ever so slowly, with canvas spread on the fore
and mizzen masts. Spirits revived and life tasted passing
sweet. To drift in the open sea upon wave-washed
rafts was an expedient which all mariners shuddered to
contemplate. It was with feelings far different that
they now assembled spars and planks and lashed and
spiked them together on the chance of needing rafts to
ferry them ashore from a stranded ship.</p>

<p>Well into the bright afternoon the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>
was wafted nearer and nearer the sandy coast.
Within a half mile of it a line of breakers frothed and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
tumbled on a shoal beyond which the water deepened
again. The ship could not be steered to avoid this
barrier. Her main deck was almost level with the sea
which lapped her gently and sobbed through the broken
bulwarks. With a slight shock she struck the shoal and
rested there just before she was ready to founder.</p>

<p>With disciplined haste, the jolly-boat was launched
and filled with its human freightage. The boatswain
went in charge and four seamen tugged at the sweeps.
There were trees and clumps of bushes among the
hillocks of sand and a tiny bight for a landing place.
The bulwark was then chopped away so that the largest
raft could be shoved into the water by means of tackles,
rollers and handspikes. It floated buoyantly and supported
as many as fifteen men, who did not mind
in the least getting their feet wet. Upon a raised platform
in the centre of the raft were fastened barrels of
beef and bread and casks of fresh water.</p>

<p>The jolly-boat could hope to make other trips between
the ship and the shore but the prudent skipper
took no chances with the weather. A sudden gale might
pluck the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> from the shoal or tear
her to fragments where she lay. Therefore most of the
men, including passengers, were embarked on the raft.
Captain Wellsby remained aboard with a few of his
sailors and our two lads, Joe and Jack, who had not attempted
to thrust themselves upon the crowded raft.</p>

<p>The pirates were making a commotion in the fore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>castle,
yammering to be freed, but the skipper had no
intention of loosing them until all his people had safely
abandoned ship. The jolly-boat made a landing without
mishap and returned to the wreck as the sun went
down. More stores were dumped into it, sacks
of potatoes and onions which had been overlooked,
bedding for the women, powder and ball for the
muskets, and other things which it was necessary to
keep dry.</p>

<p>Captain Wellsby got rid of the rest of his men on this
trip, excepting the gunner and carpenter, and these lingered
with him as a kind of body-guard pending the ticklish
business of releasing the imprisoned pirates and forsaking
them to their own devices. The jolly-boat was
laden to the gunwales and Jack Cockrell held back, saying
to Joe Hawkridge:</p>

<p>"Why trouble the captain to set us ashore? Let us
make a raft of our own. The breeze holds fair to the
beach and it will be a lark."</p>

<p>"It suits me well," grinned Joe. "If we wait to go
off with the master, and those sinful pirates see me
aboard, I'll need wings to escape 'em. They saw me
serve the gun that was filled with spikes to the muzzle.
Aye, Jack, I will feel happier to be elsewhere when
Cap'n Wellsby unbars the fo'castle and holds 'em back
with his pistols till he can cast off in the jolly-boat."</p>

<p>"Yes, the sight of you is apt to put them in a vile
temper," laughingly agreed Jack, "and 'tis awkward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
for the master to bother with us. Now about a little
raft&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Two short spars are enough. There they lie. And
the cabin hatch will do for a deck. Spikes for thole-pins,
and oars from the pinnace. Unlace the bonnet of
the jib for a sail."</p>

<p>"You are a proper sailorman, Joe. A voyage
by starlight to an unknown coast. 'Tis highly romantic."</p>

<p>They set to work without delay. Captain Wellsby
had occupations of his own and no more than glanced
at them in passing. Jack insisted on carrying a water
breaker and rations, he being hungry and too busy to
pause for supper. They would make a picnic cruise of
the adventure. Handily Joe reeved a purchase and they
hauled away until their raft slid off the sloping deck to
leeward. With a gay hurrah to Captain Wellsby, they
paddled around the stern of the ship and through the
ruffle of surf that marked the shoal.</p>

<p>In the soft twilight they trimmed the sail and swung
at the clumsy oars, while a fire blazing on the beach was
a beacon to guide their course. After a time they rested
and wiped the sweat from their faces. The progress of
the raft was like that of a lazy snail. In the luminous
darkness they pulled with all their strength. The wind
had died to a calm. The sail hung idle from its yard.
They heard, faint and afar, the deep voices of the sailors
in the jolly-boat as they returned to take the skipper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and his two companions from the ship on which a light
burned.</p>

<p>The lads shouted but there came no answering hail
from the unseen boat. They were perplexed to understand
how their courses could be so far apart. Presently
the night breeze drew off the land, bringing with
it the scent of green things growing. Joe Hawkridge
stared at the fire on the beach and then turned to look
at the spark of light on the ship. The raft had drifted
considerably to the southward. Anxiously Joe said to
his shipmate:</p>

<p>"The flood o' the tide must be setting us down the
coast, in some crazy current or other. Mayhap it runs
strong through this race betwixt the shoal and the beach
with a slant that's bad for us."</p>

<p>"I noted it," glumly agreed Jack. "The jolly-boat
passed too far away to please me. And this landward
breeze is driving us to sea."</p>

<p>"No sense in breaking our backs at these oars," grumbled
Joe. "We go ahead like a crab, with a sternboard.
Think ye we can swing the raft to fetch the
ship?"</p>

<p>"After Captain Wellsby turns the pirates loose and
quits her?" scoffed Jack.</p>

<p>"I am a plaguey fool," cheerfully admitted Joe
Hawkridge. "'Twould be out of the frying-pan into
the fire, with a vengeance."</p>

<p>"And no way to signal our friends," sadly exclaimed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Jack. "We forgot flint and steel. It looks much like
another voyage."</p>

<p>"Straight for the open sea, my bully boy," agreed
Joe. "And I'd as soon chance it on a hen-coop."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE VOYAGE OF THE LITTLE RAFT</h3>


<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HESE sturdy youngsters were not easily
frightened, and Jack Cockrell, the landsman,
was confident that wind and tide would change
to send the little raft shoreward. So tranquil was the
sea that they rode secure and dry upon the cabin hatch
which was buoyed by the two short spars. Joe Hawkridge
was silent with foreboding of a fate more bitter
than the perils which they had escaped. He had seen a
lone survivor of a crew of pirates picked off a raft in
the Caribbean, a grisly phantom raving mad who had
gnawed the flesh of his dead comrades.</div>

<p>They drifted quietly before the land breeze, beneath
a sky all jeweled with bright stars. The fire on the
beach dimmed to a red spark and then vanished from
their wistful ken. They could no longer see the light
on the wreck of the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>. Now and
then the boys struggled with the heavy oars and rowed
until exhausted but they knew they could be making no
headway against the current which had gripped the
derelict raft. They ate sparingly of flinty biscuit and
leathery beef pickled in brine and stinted themselves to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
a few swallows of water from the wooden breaker or
tiny cask.</p>

<p>"Hunger and thirst are strange to ye, Jack," said
young Hawkridge as they lay stretched side by side.
"Hanged if I ever did get enough to eat till I boarded
the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>. Skin and bone I am. I'll
not call this a bad cruise unless we have to chew our
boot-tops. A pesky diet is leather. I've tried it."</p>

<p>"Truly, Joe?" cried Jack in lugubrious accents.
"We may have more heart when morning comes. A
piping easterly breeze, such as is wont to come up with
the sun in Charles Town, and we can steer for the coast
all taut and cheery."</p>

<p>"I dread the sun, Jack. For men adrift the blaze
of it fries them like fish on a grid. A pint of water a
day, no more, is the allowance. 'Twill torture you, but
castaways can live on it. They have done it for weeks
on end. Here's two musket balls in my pocket. I can
whittle a balance from a bit of pine and we must weigh
the bread and meat."</p>

<p>"Two musket balls' weight of food for a meal?" protested
Jack.</p>

<p>"Not a morsel more," was the grim answer.
"Granted we be not washed off this silly raft and
drowned when a fresh breeze kicks up the sea, we
may hold body and soul together through five or six
days."</p>

<p>"But some vessel will sight us, Joe, even if the plight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
is as dark as your melancholy fancies paint it. And I
thought you a light-hearted mariner in danger."</p>

<p>"The sea is a cruel master and she hath taught me
prudence," was the reply. "A vessel sight us? I fear
an empty sea so soon after the storm. And honest ships
will be loth to venture out from port if the word sped
that Blackbeard was cruising off Charles Town bar."</p>

<p>Jack Cockrell forsook the attempt to wring comfort
out of his hardy companion who refused to delude himself
with vain imaginings. However, it is the blessed
gift of youth to keep the torch of hope unquenched and
presently they diverted themselves with chatting of their
earlier adventures. Jack was minded of his pompous,
stout-hearted uncle, Mr. Peter Arbuthnot Forbes, and
wondered how he had fared, whether he had set out to
return to Blackbeard's ship with the store of medicines
from Charles Town when the great storm swooped
down. Forgotten were Jack's hot grievances against
the worthy Secretary of the Council who had sought to
take a father's place. Piracy had lost its charm for
young Master Cockrell and meekly would he have
obeyed the mandate to go to school in merry England
among sober, Christian folk.</p>

<p>"Tremendous odd, I call it," exclaimed Joe Hawkridge.
"Here I was a pirate and hating the dirty business.
And my dreams were all of learnin' to be a gentleman
ashore, to know how to read books and such. Blow
me, Jack, we should ha' swapped berths."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"If my good uncle is alive I mean to commend you
to his kindness," exclaimed Jack. "We must cleave together,
and you shall have a skinful of books and school
and manners."</p>

<p>This pleased the young sea rover beyond measure and
he diverted himself with pictures of a cleaner, kindlier
world than he had ever known. In the small hours of
the night, the twain drowsed upon their frail platform
which floated as a speck on the shrouded ocean. The
waves splashed over the spars as the breeze grew livelier
and the piteous voyagers were sopping wet but the water
was not chill and they slept through this discomfort.</p>

<p>Jack Cockrell dreamed of walking in a green lane of
Charles Town with lovely Dorothy Stuart. A wave
slapped his face and he awoke with a sputtering cry of
bewilderment. The eastern sky was rosy and the sea
shimmered in the eternal beauty of a new day. Joe
Hawkridge sat huddled against the mast, chin and
knees together, his sharp eyes scanning the horizon.
With a grin he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"The watch ahoy! Rouse out, shipmate, and show a
leg! Turn to cheerly! Holystone decks and wash
down, ye lazy lubber."</p>

<p>Jack groaned and scowled as he rolled over to ease
his aching bones. He was in no mood for jesting.
There was no land in sight nor the gleam of a sail,
naught but the empty waste of the Atlantic, and the
wind still held westerly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's have the beggarly morsel you miscall breakfast,
Joe, and a swig from the breaker. Are we bound
across the main?"</p>

<p>"Straight for London River, and the school you prate
about, my bucko," replied the scamp of a pirate.
"Haul away on your belt and set the buckle tighter.
'Twill ease the cursed hunger pain that gnaws like a
rat."</p>

<p>They munched the pittance of salty food which made
the thirst the harder to endure, and then watched the
sun climb hot and dazzling. It was futile to hoist the
sail and so they pulled the canvas over them as the heat
became more intense. By noon, Jack was begging for
water to lave his tongue but Joe Hawkridge laughed
him to scorn and swore to hit him with an oar unless he
changed his tune. Never in his life had Jack known the
lack of food or drink and he therefore suffered cruelly.</p>

<p>Worse than this privation was the increasing roughness
of the sea. It was a blithesome wind, rollicking
across a sparkling carpet of blue, with the little white
clouds in flocks above, like lambs at play. But the raft
was more and more tossed about and the waves gushed
over it like foam on a reef. Through the day the castaways
might cling to it but they dreaded another night
in which their weary bodies could not possibly ward off
sleep. Even though they tied themselves fast, what if
the raft should be capsized by the heave of the mounting
swell? It was the merest makeshift, scrambled to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>gether
in haste as a ferry from the wreck of the
<i>Plymouth Adventure</i>.</p>

<p>No longer did Jack Cockrell bemoan his situation.
Taking pattern from his comrade in misery, he set his
teeth to await the end as became a true man of gentle
blood. After all, drowning was easier than the slow
torments of hunger and thirst.</p>

<p>Every little while one of them crawled from under
the canvas to look for a ship. It was the vigilant Joe
Hawkridge who, at length, discovered what was very
like a fleck of cloud on the ocean's rim, to the southward.
Afraid that his vision tricked him, he displayed no emotion
but held himself as steady as any stoic. Jack was
wildly excited, blubbering and waving his arms about.
His hard-won composure was broken to bits. But even
though it were a ship, Joe well knew it might pass afar
off and so miss sighting this bit of raft which drifted
almost submerged.</p>

<p>Slowly the semblance of a wandering fragment of
cloud climbed the curve of the watery globe until Joe
Hawkridge perceived, with a mariner's eye, that it was,
indeed, a vessel steering in their direction.</p>

<p>"Two masts!" said he, "and to'gallant-sails set to
profit by this brave breeze. A brig, Jack! Had she
been a ship, my heart 'ud ha' been in my throat. Blackbeard's
<i>Revenge</i> might be working up the coast, did she
live through the storm."</p>

<p>"A brig?" joyfully cried Jack. "Ah, ha, I see her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
two masts plainly, with mine own eyes. And they
soar too tall for a merchant trader. Her sails, too,&mdash;she
spreads them like great wings. Who else will it be
than Captain Stede Bonnet in the <i>Royal James?</i>"</p>

<p>"A shift of luck is due us, by the bones of Saint
Iago," shouted Joe, in a thrill of glad anticipation.
"Watch her closely. You saw the brig in Charles Town
harbor. Bless God, this may well be Cap'n Stede Bonnet
yonder, an' perchance he cruises in search of Blackbeard
to square accounts with that vile traitor that so
misused him."</p>

<p>"A sworn friend of mine is Stede Bonnet," proudly
declared Jack Cockrell, "and pledged to bear a hand
when I am in distress. He will land us safe in Charles
Town, Joe,&mdash;unless,&mdash;unless we choose to go a-piratin'
with him in the <i>Royal James</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jack's voice trailed off in tones of indecision so comical
that his comrade cried:</p>

<p>"Not cured yet, you big numbskull? 'Cause this fine
Cap'n Bonnet is a gentleman pirate? His neck will
stretch with the rest of 'em when the law overtakes him.
Thirteen burly lads I saw swinging in a row at Wapping
on the Thames."</p>

<p>"I'll not argue it," sheepishly mumbled Jack.
"However, we'll find a safe deliverance aboard this
<i>Royal James</i>."</p>

<p>They clung to the swaying raft while the water
washed over their knees and watched the two masts dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>close
themselves until they fancied they could not be
mistaken. No other brig as powerful as this had been
reported cruising in the waters of Virginia and the Carolinas.
By a stroke of fortune almost incredible they
had been saved at the very brink of death. The brig
was steering straight toward them, hauled to take the
wind abeam, and she would be up before sunset.</p>

<p>Shading his eyes with his hand, Joe Hawkridge suddenly
uttered a curse so fierce and wicked that it was
enough to freeze the blood. He clutched Jack's shoulder
for support as though shorn of all his strength and
hoarsely gasped:</p>

<p>"Not two masts but three! See it? She lifts high
enough to show the stump of the foremast with head-sails
jury rigged. 'Twas the storm made a brig of her!"</p>

<p>"Then she may be Blackbeard's ship?" faltered Jack,
in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Remember when the gale first broke and we parted
company?" was the reply. "The <i>Revenge</i> lost her
fore-topmast ere the swine could find their wits."</p>

<p>"Aye, Joe, but this may be some other vessel."</p>

<p>"She looks most damnably familiar," was the reluctant
admission. "A great press of sail,&mdash;it fooled
me into thinking her Stede Bonnet's brig."</p>

<p>Gloomily they waited until the black line of the hull
was visible whenever the raft lifted on the back of a
wave. This was enough for Joe. He recognized the
graceful shear of the flush deck which had been ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>tended
fore and aft to make room for a heavier main
battery. Even at a distance, a sailor's eye could read
other signs that marked this ship as the <i>Revenge</i>.</p>

<p>"The devil looks after his own," angrily exclaimed
Joe. "I'd ha' wagered my last ducat that she was
whirled away to founder. Blackbeard boasts of his compact
with Satan. I believe it's true."</p>

<p>"Shall we pull down our mast and pray that he passes
the raft as a piece of wreckage?" implored Jack.</p>

<p>Mustering his wits to meet this new crisis, Joe Hawkridge
cried impatiently:</p>

<p>"No, no, boy! This way death is sure, and most discomfortin'.
If it suits Blackbeard's whim to pick us up,
there is a chance,&mdash;a chance, I say, but make one slip
and he will run us through with his own hand."</p>

<p>"We must arrange our tale of the wreck, Joe, to
match without flaw. Quick! What have we to say?"</p>

<p>"A task for a scholar, this," grinned the sea urchin.
"If it's not well learned, we'll taste worse'n a flogging.
Where be his prize crew of pirates, asketh Blackbeard.
Answer me that, Jack."</p>

<p>"The <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> was driven upon a shoal
and lost," glibly affirmed the other lad who had rallied
to play at this hazardous game. "Her boats were stove
up. We left the pirates building a raft for themselves
and trusted ourselves to this poor contrivance, hoping to
gain the coast."</p>

<p>"Good, as far as it goes," observed the critical Joe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"And it veers close to the truth. About the ship's company?
What say you?"</p>

<p>"There I hang in the wind," confessed Jack.
"Blackbeard would have flung 'em overboard, I trow.
Have a shot at it yourself."</p>

<p>"Well, leave me to answer that when the time comes.
That we may agree, suppose we say Ned Rackham
needed the sailors to work the ship and so spared 'em.
Hanged if we can make it all true as Gospel."</p>

<p>"But if Blackbeard searches for the wreck, or if some
of those pirates rejoin him, Joe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But me no more buts," snapped the sea rover.
"We be jammed in a clove-hitch, as the seaman's lingo
hath it. Take trouble as it comes and, ware ye, don't
weaken."</p>

<p>They stared at the oncoming ship, dreading to be rescued
and even more fearful of being passed by. Disfigured
though she was by a shattered foremast, the
<i>Revenge</i> made a gallant picture as she leaned to show
the copper sheathing which flashed like gold. Her bow
flung the crested seas aside and Joe Hawkridge muttered
admiringly:</p>

<p>"A swift vessel! She carries a bone in her teeth. A
telescope can sight us soon. Steady the raft, Jack,
whilst I wriggle up this mast of ours and wave my
shirt."</p>

<p>"A hard choice," sighed Jack. "Now we well know
what it means to be betwixt the devil and the deep sea."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>They saw the <i>Revenge</i> shift her course a couple of
points as the sheets were eased off. A little way to
windward of the raft, she hove to while a small boat
was hoisted out. Curiosity prompted Blackbeard to
find out who these castaways were and from what ship
they had drifted. It occurred to Joe Hawkridge that
he might be in quest of tidings of the two sloops of his
squadron which no longer kept him company. Jack
Cockrell's teeth chattered but not with cold as the boat
bobbed away from the side of the <i>Revenge</i>. Presently
Joe recognized the pirate at the steering oar as a petty
officer who had often befriended him.</p>

<p>This fellow's swarthy, pockmarked face crinkled in
a smile as he flourished his broad hat and yelled:</p>

<p>"Stab my gizzard, but here's the London 'prentice-boy
a-cruisin' on his own adventure."</p>

<p>"Right-o, Jesse Strawn," Joe called back. "My
bark is short-handed. I need lively recruits. Will ye
enlist?"</p>

<p>The boat's crew laughed at this as they reached out
to lay hold of the raft while the two lads leaped aboard.
Joe Hawkridge carried it off with rough bravado as
though glad to be among his pals again. They eyed
Jack Cockrell with quizzical interest and he did his best
to be at ease, permitting Joe to vouch for him as a young
gentleman with a taste for piracy who had won Blackbeard's
favor in the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>. They were
plied with eager questions regarding the fate of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
merchant ship and Ned Rackham's prize crew. It was
a chance to rehearse the tale as they had concocted it,
and it seemed to hang together well enough to satisfy
these simple rogues.</p>

<p>In his turn, Joe Hawkridge demanded to know the
gossip of the <i>Revenge</i>. The storm had sobered Blackbeard,
it seemed, and he had displayed the skill of a
masterly seaman in bringing them safely through. In
toiling for their own lives, the men had forgotten their
brawls and plots and guzzling. And the great wind had
blown the ship clear of Spanish fever. There were no
new cases and the invalids were gaining strength.
Fresh food and sweet water were needed and the opinion
was that Blackbeard now steered for an old rendezvous
of his on the North Carolina coast where his sloops
would meet him if they were still afloat.</p>

<p>Jack Cockrell found his courage returning as he
clambered up the side of the <i>Revenge</i> and followed Joe
aft to the quarter-deck. Unless they bungled it, there
was a chance that they might escape when the pirates
made their landing on the coast to refresh themselves
and refit the ship. The mate on watch greeted them
good-humoredly enough and bade them enter the cabin
where the captain awaited them. Jack was all a-flutter
again but he managed to imitate Joe's careless swagger.</p>

<p>Blackbeard lounged at his ease in a huge chair of
carven ebony which might have been filched from some
stately East Indiaman or a ship of the Grand Mogul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
himself. He had flung off his coat and the sleeves of a
shirt of damask silk were rolled to the elbow. Instead
of the great, mildewed sea-boots he wore slippers of
crimson leather embroidered with threads of gold.
Gorgeous cushions, pieces of plate, costly apparel
strewed the cabin in barbaric confusion.</p>

<p>What the two lads gazed at, however, was this bizarre
figure of a despot who held the power of life and
death. It was one of his quieter interludes when he
laid aside the ferocious and bombastic play-acting which
made it hard to discover whether he was very cunning
or half-mad. The immense beard flowed down his chest
instead of being tricked out in gaudy ribbons. He was
idly running a comb through it when his small, rum-reddened
eyes took in the two lads in dripping clothes
who were shoved toward him by the sentry guarding the
hatch.</p>

<p>Blackbeard let a hairy hand stray to clutch one of the
pistols kept on the table beside him. Jack Cockrell
gulped and stole a frightened glance at Joe Hawkridge
who winked and nudged him. There was some small
comfort in this. Spellbound, they stared at the pistol
and then at the pirate's massive forearm on which a
skull and cross-bones was pricked in India ink. At this
moment Jack earnestly wished himself back on the raft.
The barrel of the pistol looked as big as a blunderbuss.</p>

<p>With a yawn, Blackbeard reached for a silver bowl
of Brazil nuts, cracked one of them with the pistol-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>butt
and roared for the black cabin boy who came running
with a flask of Canary wine and a goblet. Jack
Cockrell's sigh of relief sounded like a porpoise coming
up for air. He was not to be shot at once. Suddenly
Blackbeard exclaimed, in that husky, growling voice of
his:</p>

<p>"I saw you rascals through the glass before I came
below. What of the ship I left ye in? Briefly now, and
no lies."</p>

<p>Together the lads pieced out the narrative as they had
hastily prepared it. The vital thing was to watch lest
they tell a word too much. Jack stumbled once or twice
but his comrade covered it adroitly, and they did not
betray themselves. The sweat trickled into their eyes
but the heat of the cabin was excuse for this. Blackbeard
studied them intently, munching Brazil nuts and
noisily sipping his wine.</p>

<p>"The <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> stranded yester-eve?"
said he. "Know ye the lay of the coast where the wreck
lies? What of the shipmaster and Ned Rackham?
Were they able to fix the shoal by reckoning?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," readily answered Joe Hawkridge.
"'Twas strange land to all hands."</p>

<p>From a chest Blackbeard hauled out a dog-eared chart
of parchment and unrolled it upon the table. The boys
foresaw his intention and feared the worst. Presently
they heard him mumble to himself:</p>

<p>"A small wind setting from the west'ard,&mdash;twenty-four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
hours of drift for the lads' raft,&mdash;a dozen leagues,
I call it."</p>

<p>He looked up from the chart to ask:</p>

<p>"The wreck was lodged fast in smooth water and
holding together?"</p>

<p>"Aye, but in peril of working off and sinking like
an iron pot," answered Joe. "For this reason the people
were in haste to quit her."</p>

<p>"Her own crew made for the beach, I have no doubt,"
shrewdly pursued Blackbeard, "but my men 'ud stay
by the wreck and watch the weather ere they shoved off.
Trust the food and drink and plunder to hold 'em."</p>

<p>He lumbered to the hatch and called up to the mate
on watch. While they conferred, Joe Hawkridge whispered
to his perturbed companion:</p>

<p>"He will hunt for the wreck, Jack. But unless the
wind changes, he can't beat in to the coast with his fore-topmast
gone."</p>

<p>"A merciful delay," muttered Jack. "I worry not
so much for Captain Wellsby and his people. They
will hide themselves well inland when they make out the
<i>Revenge</i>, but what of you and me?"</p>

<p>"'Tis a vexing life we lead. I will say that much,
Master Cockrell."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE MIST OF THE CHEROKEE SWAMP</h3>


<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE dark cloud of anxiety was lightened a trifle
by the fact that Blackbeard displayed no ill
temper toward the two young castaways.
Having obtained such information as they chose to offer,
he roughly told them to go forward and join the crew.
Whether or no, Jack was impressed as a pirate and it
may have amused Blackbeard to recruit by force the
nephew of the honorable Secretary of the Provincial
Council. For his part, Jack was grateful to be regarded
no longer as a hostage under sentence of death. With
Joe as an escort who knew the ropes, he went on deck
and was promptly kicked off the poop by the mate.</div>

<p>They first found food and quenched their raging
thirst with water which had a loathsome smell. Joe reported
to the chief gunner and begged the chance to
sleep for a dozen hours on end. This was granted amiably
enough and the pirates clustered about to ask all
manner of curious questions, but the weary lads dragged
themselves into the bows of the ship and curled up in a
stupor. There they lay as if drugged, all through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
night, even when the seamen trampled over them to
haul the head-sails and tack ship.</p>

<p>When, at last, they blinked at the morning sky, it
dismayed them to find the breeze blowing strong out of
the southeast and the <i>Revenge</i> standing in to the coast
under easy sail. They looked aft and saw Blackbeard
at the rail with a long glass at his eye. The whole crew
was eager with expectation and the routine work went
undone. The ship had been put about several hours
earlier, Joe learned, and was due soon to sight the shore
unless the reckoning was all at fault.</p>

<p>So cleverly had Blackbeard calculated the drift of the
boys' raft that a little later in the morning a lookout in
the maintop called down:</p>

<p>"Land, ho! Two points off the starboard bow she
bears."</p>

<p>"The maintop, ahoy!" shouted Blackbeard. "Can
ye see a vessel's spars?"</p>

<p>"'Tis too hazy inshore. But unless my eyes play me
tricks, a smudge of smoke arises."</p>

<p>Jack Cockrell nervously confided to Joe:</p>

<p>"That would be Captain Wellsby's campfire on the
beach."</p>

<p>"Trust him to douse it," was the easy assurance. "I
feel better. Blow me, but I expect to live another day."</p>

<p>"Answer me why," begged Jack. "I am like a palsied
old man."</p>

<p>"Well, you know this bit o' coast, how low it sets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
above the sea. Despite the haze, a man aloft could see
a ship's masts and yards before he had a glimpse of
land."</p>

<p>"Then the wreck of the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> has
slid off the shoal and gone down, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, when the wind veered and stirred a surf on the
shoal. She pounded over with the flood-tide and
dropped into fifteen fathom."</p>

<p>"Then we are saved, for now?" joyfully exclaimed
Jack.</p>

<p>"Unless we're unlucky enough to find some o' those
plaguey pirates afloat on a raft or makin' signals from
the beach."</p>

<p>The <i>Revenge</i> sailed shoreward until those on board
could discern the marching lines of breakers which tumbled
across the shoal. The smudge of smoke had vanished
from the beach. The lookout man concluded that
the haze had deceived him. Blackbeard steered as close
as he dared go, with a sailor heaving the lead, but there
was no sign of life among the sand-dunes and the stunted
trees. And the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> had disappeared
leaving no trace excepting scattered bits of floating
wreckage.</p>

<p>The pirate ship headed to follow the coast to the
northward, on the chance that Ned Rackham's prize
crew might have made a landing elsewhere. To Jack
Cockrell the gift of life had been miraculously vouchsafed
him and he felt secure for the moment. Joe's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
theory seemed plausible, that the pirates had abandoned
the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> in time to avert drowning
with her, and were driven away from the bight and the
beach by Captain Wellsby's well-armed sailors.</p>

<p>"Do they know Blackbeard's rendezvous in the North
Carolina waters, Joe?" was the natural query. "Are
they likely to make their way thither, knowing that honest
men will slay them at sight?"</p>

<p>"The swamps and the murderous Indians will take
full toll of 'em, Jack. I believe we have seen the last of
those rogues, but I'd rest better could I know for certain."</p>

<p>"Meanwhile this mad Blackbeard may be taken in
one of his savage frenzies and shoot me for sport," said
young Master Cockrell, for whom existence had come to
be one hazard after another.</p>

<p>"He seems strangely tame, much like a human soul,"
observed Joe. "I ne'er beheld him like this. He plots
some huge mischief, methinks."</p>

<p>And now the ship's officers drove the men to their
work but they were less abusive than usual. They
seemed to reflect Blackbeard's milder humor and it was
manifest that they wished to avoid the crew's resentment.
Joe Hawkridge was puzzled and began to ferret
it out among his friends who were trustworthy. They
had their own suspicions and the general opinion was
that Blackbeard was in great dread of encountering
Captain Stede Bonnet in the <i>Royal James</i>. It seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
that the <i>Revenge</i> had spoken a disabled merchant ship
just after the storm and her skipper reported that he
had been overhauled by Stede Bonnet a few days earlier
and the best of his cargo stolen. Blackbeard had been
seized with violent rage but had suffered the ship to proceed
on her way because of his own short-handed condition.</p>

<p>With a prize crew lost in the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>,
including Sailing-Master Ned Rackham, and the two
sloops of the squadron missing with all hands, the terrible
Blackbeard was in poor shape to meet this Captain
Bonnet who hated him beyond measure. As if this were
not gloomy enough, there were men in the <i>Revenge</i>
eager to sail under Bonnet's flag and to mutiny if ever
they sighted the <i>Royal James</i>. It behooved Blackbeard
to press on to that lonely inlet on the North Carolina
coast and avoid the open sea until he could prepare to
fight this dangerous foeman.</p>

<p>It surprised Jack Cockrell to see how quiet a pirate
ship could be. The ruffians were bone-weary, for one
thing, after the struggle to bring the vessel through the
storm. And the scourge of tropic fever had left its
marks. Moreover, the rum was running short because
some of the casks had been staved in the heavy weather
and Blackbeard was doling it out as grog with an ample
dilution of water. There was no more dicing and brawling
and tipsy choruses. Sobered against their will, some
of these bloody-minded sinners talked repentance or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
shed tears over wives and children deserted in distant
ports.</p>

<p>The wind blew fair until the <i>Revenge</i> approached the
landmarks familiar to Blackbeard and found a channel
which led to the wide mouth of Cherokee Inlet. It was
a quiet roadstead sheltered from seaward by several
small islands. The unpeopled swamp and forest fringed
the shores but a green meadow and a margin of white
sand offered a favorable place for landing. As the
<i>Revenge</i> slowly rounded the last wooded point, the tall
mast of a sloop became visible. The pirates cheered and
discharged their muskets in salute as they recognized one
of the consorts which had been blown away in the storm.</p>

<p>Blackbeard strutted on his quarter-deck, no longer
biting his nails in fretful anxiety. He had donned the
military coat with the glittering buttons and epaulets
and the huge cocked hat with the feather in it. He
noted that the sloop, which was called the <i>Triumph</i>,
fairly buzzed with men, many more than her usual complement.
No sooner had the ship let her anchor splash
than a boat was sent over to her with the captain of the
sloop who made haste to pay his compliments and explain
his voyage. He was a portly, sallow man with a
blustering manner and looked more like a bailiff or a
tapster than a brine-pickled gentleman of fortune.</p>

<p>Blackbeard hailed him cordially and invited him into
the cabin. The boat waited alongside the <i>Revenge</i> and
the men scrambled aboard to swap yarns with the ship's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
crew. Jack Cockrell hovered near the group as they
squatted on their heels around a tub of grog and learned
that the <i>Triumph</i> had rescued the crew of the other sloop
just before it had foundered. There were a hundred men
of them, in all, crowded together like dried herring, and
part were sleeping ashore in huts of boughs and canvas.
No wonder Blackbeard was in blither spirits. Here was
a company to pick and choose from and so fill the depleted
berth-deck of the <i>Revenge</i>.</p>

<p>Finding the poop deserted, Joe Hawkridge ventured
far enough to peer in at a cabin window. Blackbeard
was at table, together with his first mate, the chief
gunner, the acting sailing-master, and the captain of the
sloop. They were exceeding noisy, singing most discordantly
and laughing at indecent jests. Suddenly
Blackbeard whipped two pistols from his sash and fired
them under the table, quite at random.</p>

<p>The first mate leaped up with a horrible yell and
clapped a hand to the calf of his leg. Then he bolted
out of the cabin, which was blue with smoke, and limped
in search of the surgeon. Joe Hawkridge dodged aside
but he heard the jovial Blackbeard shout, with a whoop
of laughter:</p>

<p>"Discipline, damme! If I don't kill one of you now
and then, you'll forget who I am."</p>

<p>Inasmuch as none of the other guests dared squeak
after this episode, it was to be inferred that they were
properly impressed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">THE FIRST MATE LEAPED UP WITH A HORRIBLE YELL</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>In a little while the mate returned with his leg neatly
bandaged, announced that it was a mere flesh wound,
and sat down as though nothing out of the ordinary had
occurred to mar the festive occasion. Through the rest
of the day, boats were passing between the ship and the
sloop in a convivial reunion. Supper was to be cooked
on the beach in great iron kettles and a frolic would
follow the feast. The sloop had rum enough to sluice
all the parched gullets aboard the <i>Revenge</i>.</p>

<p>Jack Cockrell had no desire to join this stupid revel
but he was eager to get ashore to discover what opportunity
there might be to escape. But the wiser Joe
Hawkridge counseled patience, saying:</p>

<p>"Wait a bit. We'd be as helpless as any babes should
we take to our heels in this ungodly wilderness. Is
there a town or plantation near by?"</p>

<p>"I know not," ruefully confessed Jack. "Charles
Town lies to the south, and Virginia to the north.
There my knowledge fetches up short."</p>

<p>"And leagues of morass to flounder through, by the
look of this coast," said Joe. "We be without weapons,
or food, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am a hot-headed fool, I grant you that," broke in
Jack. "Now bestow your sage advice."</p>

<p>"You will not be allowed to go ashore, for one thing,
Master Cockrell. Blackbeard has no notion of letting
you get away from him to betray this rendezvous and
stir the colonies to send an expedition after him. Steady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the helm, Jack, and watch for squalls. If I can read the
signs, there is trouble afoot. And we must seek our own
advantage in the nick of time."</p>

<p>"But these wild sots no longer think of mutiny and
the like, Joe. They are content to let the morrow go
hang."</p>

<p>"S-s-s-h, 'ware the master of the sloop," cautioned
Joe. "He makes for the gangway, the big lump of
tallow."</p>

<p>They moved away while Captain Richard Spender
clumsily descended into his boat, his broad face flushed,
his breath asthmatic. He had a piping voice absurd for
his bulk and the two lads amused themselves with mimicking
him as the boat pulled in the direction of the
sloop. So safe against surprise did Blackbeard regard
himself in this lonely anchorage that no more than a
dozen men were left aboard to keep the ship through the
night. Among these was Jack Cockrell, as his comrade
had foreseen. It therefore happened that they remained
together, for Joe had volunteered to join the anchor
watch. In a melancholy mood the two lads idled upon
the after deck.</p>

<p>The sun dropped behind the dark and tangled forest
and flights of herons came winging it home to the islets
in the swamps. On the sward by the silver strand the
throng of pirates had stilled their clamor while a rascal
with a tenor voice held them enraptured with the haunting
refrain of:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>"Sweet Annie frae the sea-beach came,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Where Jockey's climbed the vessel's side:</span><br />

</div>

<p>Forlorn Jack Cockrell had homesick thoughts and
felt hopeless of loosing the snares which bound him.
All that sustained his courage was the sanguine disposition
of Joe Hawkridge, whose youthful soul had been so
battered and toughened by dangers manifold on land
and sea that he expected nothing less. Listening to the
pirate's moving ballad, they sat and swung their legs
from the ship's taffrail while their gaze idly roved to the
green curtain of undergrowth which ran lush to the
water's edge to the northward of the beach.</p>

<p>It was Joe who called attention to a floating object
which moved inside the mouth of the small, tidal creek
that wandered through the marshy lowlands. In the
shadowy light it could easily be mistaken for a log drifting
down on the ebb of the tide. This was what the lads
assumed it to be until they both noticed a behavior curious
in a log. The long, low object turned athwart the
current at the entrance of the creek and shot toward the
nearest bank as though strongly propelled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe lifted the telescope from its case in front of the
wooden binnacle-box and squinted long at the edge of
the creek. Crude though the glass was, he was enabled
to discern that the object was, in truth, a log, but evidently
hollowed out. Rounded at the ends, it held two
men whose figures so blended into the dusk that they
disclosed themselves only when in motion.</p>

<p>"A pirogue," said Joe, "and fashioned by Indians!
What is the tribe hereabouts? Have ye a guess?"</p>

<p>"Roving Yemassees, or men of the Hatteras tribe,"
answered Jack. "Yonder brace of savages will be
scouts."</p>

<p>"Aye, but there'll be no attack 'gainst this pirates'
bivouac, right under the guns of the ships. The Indians
are too wise to attempt it."</p>

<p>"Look, Joe! Hand me the glass. Those two spies
have quitted the pirogue. 'Tis quite empty. They
may lay up all night to creep closer and keep watch on
the camp."</p>

<p>"Right enough, by Crambo! If we could but gain
yon cypress canoe, and steal along the coast by sail and
paddle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Tis the chance we prayed for," eagerly exclaimed
Jack. "Dare we swim for it?"</p>

<p>"Not with a boat just coming off from shore. What
if we try it in the night and find the pirogue gone?"</p>

<p>"We are stranded for sure, and Blackbeard will
kill us."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Baffled, they strained their eyes until the shore stood
black in the starlight, but as long as the dusk lingered
they fancied they could descry the empty pirogue. The
ship's boat which presently drew alongside contained
Blackbeard himself and Captain Dick Spender of the
<i>Triumph</i> sloop, besides several officers of the two vessels.
They withdrew into the cabin and there was prolonged
discussion, lasting well toward midnight.</p>

<p>It was a secretive session, with trusted men of the
boat's crew posted to keep eavesdroppers away from the
hatches and windows, nor was there any loud carousing.
Some business was afoot and Jack wondered whether it
might concern the trouble which Joe had sworn was
brewing under the surface. A circumstance even more
suspicious was that three of the sailors from the boat
were called into the cabin. Joe Hawkridge knew them
as fellows loyal to Blackbeard through thick and thin.
Drunken beasts, as a rule, they were cold sober to-night.</p>

<p>As quietly as they had come, the whole party dropped
into the boat and returned either to the beach or to the
sloop which rode at anchor two cable-lengths away.
The <i>Revenge</i> floated with no more activity on her darkened
decks. The few men of the watch drowsed at their
stations or wistfully gazed at the fires ashore and the
mob of pirates who moved in the red glare. Jack Cockrell
and Joe Hawkridge felt no desire for sleep. As the
ship swung with the turn of the tide, they went to the
side and leaned on the tall bulwark where they might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
catch the first glimpse of the shore with the break of
day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile they busied themselves with this wild
scheme and that. Sifting them out, it was resolved to
swim from the ship at the first opportunity. If they
could not find the Indian pirogue, Joe would try to get
into the pirates' camp by night and possess himself of an
axe, an adze, a musket or two, and such food as he could
smuggle out. Then, at a pinch, they could hide themselves
a little way inland and hew out a pirogue of their
own from a dry log. After hitting upon this plan, the
better it seemed the more they thrashed it over.</p>

<p>Unluckily it occurred to them so late in the night that
they feared to attempt it then lest the dawn might overtake
them while they were swimming. 'Twas a great
pity, said Joe, that their wits had hung fire, like a damp
flint-lock, for this was the night when the pirates
would be the most slack and befuddled and it would be
precious hard waiting through another day. Jack
glumly agreed with this point of view.</p>

<p>It was so near morning, however, that they lingered
to scan the shore. Then it was observed that a pearly
mist was rising from the swamp lands and spreading out
over the water. It was almost like a fog which the
morning breeze would dispel after a while. Rolling like
smoke it hung so low that the topmast of the sloop rose
above it although her hull was like the gray ghost of a
vessel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"No sign of wind as yet," said Joe, holding up a
wetted finger, "and that red sunset bespoke a calm, hot
day. This odd smother o' mist may stay a couple of
hours. Will ye venture it with me, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Gladly! Over we go, before the watch is flogged
awake by the bos'n's mate."</p>

<p>They crept aft to the high stern and paid out a coil
of rope until it trailed in the water beneath the railed
gallery which overhung the huge rudder. Joe belayed
his end securely and slid over like a flash, twisting the
rope around one leg and letting himself down as agile
as a monkey. Without a splash he cast himself loose
and Jack followed but not so adroitly. When he
plopped into the water the commotion was like tossing a
barrel overboard, but nobody sounded an alarm.</p>

<p>They clung to the rusty rudder chains and listened.
The ship was all quiet. Then out into the mist they
launched themselves, swimming almost submerged,
dreading to hear an outcry and the spatter of musket
balls. But the veiling mist and the uncertain light of
dawn soon protected the fugitives. It was slow, exhausting
progress, hampered as they were by their
breeches and shoes which could not be discarded. They
tried to keep a sense of direction, striking out for the
mouth of the creek in which the pirogue had been
moored, but the tide set them off the course and the only
visible marks were the spars of the ship behind them and
the sloop's topmast off to one side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>


<p>Jack swam more strongly and showed greater endurance
because he had the beef and had been better nourished
all his life than the scrawny young powder boy
who was more like a lath. Now and then Jack paused
to tread water while his shipmate clung to his shoulder
and husbanded his waning strength, with that indomitable
grin on his freckled phiz. Of one thing they were
thankful, that the tide was bearing them farther away
from the pirates' camp, which was now as still as though
the sleepers were dead men.</p>

<p>"Blood and bones, but I have swum a league
a'ready," gurgled Joe during one of the halts.</p>

<p>"Shut your mouth or you'll fill up to the hatch and
founder," scolded Jack. "I see trees in the mist. The
shore is scarce a pistol shot away."</p>

<p>"I pray my keel scrapes soon," spluttered the waterlogged
Hawkridge as he kicked himself along in a final
effort.</p>

<p>Huzza, their feet touched the soft ooze and they fell
over stumps and rotted trunks buried under the surface.
Scratched and beplastered with mud, they crawled
out in muck which gripped them to the knees, and
roosted like buzzards upon the butt of a prostrate live-oak.</p>

<p>"Marooned," quoth Joe, "to be eaten by snakes and
alligators."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," snapped Master Cockrell, who had
hunted deer and wild-fowl on the Carolina coast. "We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
can pick our way with care. I have seen pleasanter
landscapes than this, but I like it better than Blackbeard's
company."</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 411px;">

<span class="caption">JACK ALMOST BUMPED INTO THE DUGOUT CANOE</span>
</div>

<p>There was no disputing this statement and Joe
plucked up spirit, as was his habit when another arduous
task confronted him. Cautiously they made their way
from one quaking patch of sedge to another or scrambled
to their middles. There came a ridge of higher
ground thick with brambles and knotted vines and they
traversed this with less misery. A gleam of water
among the trees and they took it to be the creek which
they sought to find. Wary of lurking Indians, they
wormed along on their stomachs and so came to the high
swamp grass of the bank.</p>

<p>They swam the creek and crept toward its mouth.
Jack was rooting along like a bear when he almost
bumped into the dugout canoe which had looked so very
like a stranded log. It was tied to a tree by a line of
twisted fibre and the rising tide had borne it well up into
the marsh. Here it was invisible from the ship and only
a miracle of good fortune had revealed it to the lads in
that glimpse from the deck at sundown.</p>

<p>They crawled over the gunwale and slumped in the
bottom of the pirogue, which was larger than they expected,
a clumsy yet seaworthy craft with a wide floor
and space to crowd a dozen men. Fire had helped to
hollow it from a giant of a cypress log, for the inner
skin was charred black. Three roughly made paddles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
were discovered. This was tremendously important,
and all they lacked was a mast and sail to be true navigators.</p>

<p>Something else they presently found which was so
unlooked for, so incredible, that they could only gape
and stare at each other. Tucked in the bow was a seaman's
jacket of tarred canvas, of the kind used in wet
weather. Sewed to the inside of it was a pocket of
leather with a buttoned flap. This Jack Cockrell proceeded
to explore, recovering from his stupefaction, and
fished out a wallet bound in sharkskin as was the habit
of sailors to make for themselves in tropic waters. It
contained nothing of value, a few scraps of paper
stitched together, a bit of coral, a lock of yellow hair, a
Spanish coin, some shreds of dried tobacco leaf.</p>

<p>Carefully Jack examined the ragged sheets of paper
which seemed to be a carelessly jotted diary of dates and
events. Upon the last leaf was scrawled, "<i>Bill Saxby,
His Share</i>," and beneath this entry such items as these:</p>

<div class="hang1">"Aprl. ye 17&mdash;A Spanish shippe rich laden.
1 sack Vanilla. 2 Rolls Blue Cloth of
Peru. 1 Packet Bezoar Stones.<br /></div>

<div class="hang1">"May ye 24&mdash;A Poor Shippe. 3 Bars of
Silver. 1 Case Cordial Waters. A
Golden Candle-stick. My share by Lot
afore ye Mast."</div>

<p>Joe Hawkridge could neither read nor write but he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
had ready knowledge of the meaning of these entries and
he cried excitedly:</p>

<p>"Say the name again, Jack. Bill Saxby, His Share.
Strike me blind, but I was chums with Bill when we lay
off Honduras. As decent a lad as ever went a-piratin'!
A heart of oak is Bill, hailin' from London town."</p>

<p>"But what of the riddle?" impatiently demanded
Jack. "Whence this Indian pirogue? And where is
Bill Saxby?"</p>

<p>"He sailed with Stede Bonnet, bless ye," answered
Joe. "These two men we spied in the canoe last night
were no Indians. <i>They were Cap'n Bonnet's men.</i>
Indians would ha' hid the pirogue more craftily."</p>

<p>"But they came not along the coast. Did they drop
down this creek from somewhere inland?"</p>

<p>"There you put me in stays," confessed Joe. "One
thing I can swear. They were sent to look for Blackbeard's
ships. And I sore mistrust they were caught
whilst prowling near the camp. Else they would ha'
come back to the canoe before day."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE EPISODE OF THE WINDING CREEK</h3>


<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE singular discovery of Bill Saxby's jacket
was like a shock to drive all else out of their
minds. Now they found that it had been
thrown over a jug of water and a bag of beef and biscuit
stowed in the bow. This solved one pressing problem,
and they nibbled the hard ration while debating the situation.
It was agreed that they could not honorably run
away with the pirogue if it really belonged to Stede
Bonnet's men, who must have come on foot along the
higher ground back of the coast and descended the creek
in the canoe stolen or purchased from Indians met by
chance.</div>

<p>Granted this much, it was fair to conjecture that Captain
Bonnet's ship was in some harbor not many leagues
distant and that he knew where to find Blackbeard's rendezvous,
at Cherokee Inlet.</p>

<p>"'Tis your job to stand by the pirogue, Jack," suggested
Hawkridge, "and I will make a sally toward the
pirates' camp afore they rouse out."</p>

<p>"Go softly, Joe, and don't be reckless. Why not lie
up till night before you reconnoitre?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Cause the mist still hangs heavy and I'm blowed if
I dilly-dally if good Bill Saxby has come to grief."</p>

<p>"Supposing he has, you cannot wrest him single-handed
from Blackbeard's crew."</p>

<p>"Well, if I can but slip a word of comfort in his ear,
it'll cheer him mightily, unless his throat be cut by now,"
was the stubborn response. "Sit thee taut, Jack, old
<i>camarada</i>, and chuck the worry. Care killed a cat.
These rogues yonder in the camp won't <i>molest me</i> if I
walk boldly amongst 'em."</p>

<p>"What if you don't return?" persisted Jack. "How
long shall I wait here with the pirogue?"</p>

<p>"Now what the deuce can I say to such foolish
queries? If things go wrong with me and Bill and his
mate, you will have to cruise alone or hop back to the
<i>Revenge</i>."</p>

<p>With a laugh and a wave of the hand, the dauntless
adventurer leaped from the nose of the canoe, nimbly
hauled himself into a tree, and then plunged into the
gloomy swamp where he was speedily lost to view. Jack
Cockrell settled himself to wait for he knew not what.
Clouds of midges and mosquitoes tormented him and he
ached with fatigue. Soon after sunrise the mist began
to burn away and the mouth of the creek was no longer
obscured by shadows. In the glare of day Jack thought
it likely that the canoe might be detected by some pair
of keen eyes aboard the <i>Revenge</i>.</p>

<p>To move it far might imperil Joe Hawkridge and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Bonnet's two seamen should they come in haste with a
hue-and-cry behind them. Jack paddled the pirogue
up the creek and soon found a safe ambuscade, a stagnant
cove in among the dense growth, where he tied up
to a gnarled root. Then he climbed a wide-branching
oak and propped himself in a crotch from which he could
see the open water and the two vessels at anchor.
Clumps of taller trees cut off any view of the beach and
the camp but he dared stray no farther from the pirogue.</p>

<p>Tediously an hour passed and there was no sign of
Joe Hawkridge. He had a journey of only a few hundred
yards to make, and Jack began to imagine all kinds
of misfortune that might have befallen him, such as being
mired beyond his depth in the swamp and perishing
miserably. The sensible conclusion was, however, that
he had tarried among his shipmates in the camp with
some shrewd purpose in mind.</p>

<p>A little later in the morning, Jack's anxious cogitations
were diverted by the frequent passage of boats between
the <i>Revenge</i> and the sloop which was anchored
nearer the beach. One of these small craft was Blackbeard's
own cock-boat, or captain's gig, which he used
for errands in smooth water, with a couple of men to
pull it. Jack was reminded of that secret conference in
the cabin and Joe's conviction that some uncommon devilment
was afoot. It appeared as though "Tallow
Dick" Spender, that unwholesome master of the <i>Triumph</i>
sloop, had been chosen as the right bower.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>And now there arose a sudden and riotous noise in the
camp. It was not the mirth and song of jolly pirates
a-pleasuring ashore but the ferocious tumult of men in
conflict and taken unawares. Perched in the tree, Jack
Cockrell listened all agog as the sounds rose and fell
with the breeze which swayed the long gray moss that
draped the branches. He heard a few pistol shots and
then was startled to see a spurt of flame dart from a
gun-port of the sloop. The dull report reached him an
instant later. He could see that the gun had been fired
from the vessel's shoreward battery. It meant that
Blackbeard was making a target of some part of the
camp. Another gun belched its cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>The noise died down, save for intermittent shouts and
one long wail of anguish. Presently a boat moved out
past the sloop. A dozen men tugged at the oars and
others stood crowded in the stern-sheets. Jack caught
the gleam of weapons and thought he recognized the
squat, broad figure of Blackbeard himself beside the
man at the steering oar. Behind this pinnace from the
<i>Revenge</i> trailed two other boats in tow. They passed
in slow procession, out between the vessels. The boats
which the pinnace towed were not empty. Instead of
sitting upon the thwarts, men seemed to be strewn about
in them as if they had been tossed over the gunwales like
so much dunnage.</p>

<p>Jack rubbed his eyes in amazement and watched the
line of boats turn to follow the channel which led out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the sheltered roadstead to the sea beyond. When they
vanished beyond a sandy island, the lad in the live-oak
tree said to himself:</p>

<p>"My guess is that Blackbeard has put a stopper on
all talk of mutiny by one bold stroke. A bloody weeding-out,
and in those two boats are the poor wretches
who were taken alive. Alas, one of 'em may be Joe
Hawkridge unless he be dead already. He talked too
much of Stede Bonnet aboard the ship. And there were
sneaking dogs in the crew who spied on their comrades.
We saw them enter the cabin last night."</p>

<p>There was no getting around the evidence. It fitted
together all too well. Jack sadly reflected that, beyond
a doubt, he had seen the last of gallant, loyal Joe Hawkridge.
Left alone with the pirogue, which he could not
paddle single-handed, it was folly to think of trying to
escape along the coast. And to wander inland, ignorant
of the country, was to court almost certain death.
Nor could he now expect mercy from Blackbeard, having
deserted the ship against orders and known to be a
true friend of Captain Stede Bonnet.</p>

<p>The most unhappy lad could no longer hold his
cramped station in the tree and he decided to seek the
canoe and find the meagre solace of a little food and
water. He was half-way to the ground when he clutched
a limb and halted to peer into the swamp. Something
was splashing through the mud and grass and making a
prodigious fuss about it. Then Jack heard two voices<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
in grunts and maledictions. Fearing the enemy might
have tracked him, he stood as still as a mouse in the leafage
of the oak.</p>

<p>Out of the swamp emerged a young man with a musket
on his shoulder. Behind him came one very much
older, gaunt and wrinkled, his hair as gray as the Spanish
moss that overhung his path. They reached the edge
of the creek and then turned down to halt where the
pirogue had been left. At failing to find it there, they
argued hotly and were much distressed. Jack Cockrell's
fears were calmed. These were no men of Blackbeard's
company, but good Bill Saxby and his mate.
He called to them from his perch and they stood wondering
at this voice from heaven.</p>

<p>In a jiffy Jack had slid down and was beckoning
them. They hurried as fast as they could pull their
feet out of the muck, and were overjoyed to jump into
the hidden canoe. There they sat and thumped Jack
Cockrell on the head by way of affectionate greeting.
The younger man had a chubby cheek, a dimple in his
chin, and blue eyes as big and round as a babe's.</p>

<p>"Bill Saxby is me," said his pleasant voice, "and a
precious job had I to get here. Joe Hawkridge told me
of you, Master Cockrell."</p>

<p>"Where is Joe?" cried Jack, dreading to hear his
own opinion confirmed.</p>

<p>"Marooned, along with two dozen luckless lads that
were trapped like pigeons&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Twas more like turtles all a-sleepin' in the sand,"
the old man croaked in rusty accents. "A few was
sharp awake and they fought pretty whilst the rest rallied,
but they got drove with their backs to the swamp
and a deep slough. Then the sloop turned her guns on
'em and they struck their colors."</p>

<p>"And Joe Hawkridge sided with his friends, of
course," said Jack.</p>

<p>"Would ye expect aught else of him?" proudly answered
Bill Saxby. "He searched us out where we lay
trussed like fowls, all bound with ropes. We blundered
fair into the camp last night, and old Trimble Rogers
here, his legs knotted with cramps, couldn't make a run
for it. They saved us for Blackbeard's pleasure but he
had other fish to fry."</p>

<p>"What then?" demanded Jack.</p>

<p>"'Twas Joe Hawkridge that ran to cut our bonds
when the fight began. And he bade us leg it for the
pirogue and carry word to you. A pledge of honor, he
called it, to stand by his dear friend Jack, and he made
us swear it."</p>

<p>"Bless him for a Christian knight of a pirate," said
Jack, with tears in his eyes. "Was he hurt, did ye
happen to note?"</p>

<p>"We hid ourselves till the prisoners were flung into
the boats. I marked Joe as one of 'em, and he was
sprightly, barring a bloody face."</p>

<p>"Marooned, Bill Saxby?" asked Jack. "What's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
your judgment on that score? It cannot be many
leagues from here, or the ship would have transported
them instead of the boats."</p>

<p>"These barren islands lie strung well out from the
coast, Master Cockrell. Waterless they be, and without
shelter. Blackbeard's fancy is to let the men die
there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An ancient custom of buccaneers and pirates," put
in old Trimble Rogers, with an air of grave authority.
"I mind me in the year of 1687 when I sailed in the
South Sea with that great captain, Edward Davis,&mdash;'twas
after the sack of Guayaquil when every man had a
greater weight of gold and silver than he could lug on
his back&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bill Saxby interrupted, in a petulant manner:</p>

<p>"Stow it, grandsire! At a better time ye can please
the lad with your long-winded yarns,&mdash;of marching on
Panama with Henry Morgan when the mother's milk
was scarce dry on your lips."</p>

<p>"I cruised with the best of 'em," boasted the last of
the storied race of true buccaneers of the Spanish Main,
"and now I be in this cheap trade of piratin'. The fortunes
I gamed away, and the plate ships I boarded!
Take warnin', boy, and salt your treasure down."</p>

<p>"This Trimble Rogers will talk you deaf," said Bill
Saxby, "but there's pith in his old bones and wisdom
under yon hoary thatch. Cap'n Bonnet sent him along
with me as a rare old hound to trail the swamps."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>In a vivid flash of remembrance, Jack Cockrell saw
this salty relic of the Spanish Main among the crew
which had disported itself on the tavern green at Charles
Town,&mdash;the old man sitting aside with a couple of stray
children upon his knees while his head nodded to the lilt
of the fiddle. And again there had been a glimpse of
him trudging in the column which had followed Stede
Bonnet, with trumpet and drum, to attack the hostile
Indians. Jack's heart warmed to Trimble Rogers and
also to young Bill Saxby. They would find some way
out of all this tribulation.</p>

<p>"Whither lies Captain Bonnet's stout ship?" eagerly
demanded Jack.</p>

<p>"On this side the Western Ocean," smiled Saxby.
"We shall waste no time in finding her. We had better
bide where we are a few hours, eh, Trimble?"</p>

<p>"Aye, and double back up the stream in the canoe to
spend the night on dry land and push on afoot at dawn.
If we wait to sight Blackbeard's boats come in from sea,
'twill aid us to reckon how far out they went and what
the bearings are."</p>

<p>"So Captain Bonnet may sail to pick off those poor
seamen marooned," exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>"He is not apt to leave 'em to bleach their bones,"
said Bill Saxby. "And when it comes to closing in with
Blackbeard, they will have a grudge of their own."</p>

<p>They made themselves as comfortable as possible on
the bottom of the pirogue. Now and then Jack climbed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the live-oak to look for the return of the boats. There
was no more leisure for the pirates left in the ship and
the sloop. Evidently Blackbeard had been alarmed by
the tidings that two of Stede Bonnet's men had been
caught spying him out and had made their escape in the
confusion. The sloop was now listed over in shoal
water and Bill Saxby ventured the opinion that they
intended to take the mast out of her and put it in the
<i>Revenge</i>.</p>

<p>"Along with most of her guns, I take it," said Trimble
Rogers. "What with losing all those men, in one way
or another, this Blackbeard, as Cap'n Ed'ard Teach miscalls
hisself, must needs abandon the sloop. The more
the merrier, says I, when we come at close quarters."</p>

<p>Jack asked many curious questions, by way of passing
the time. The old man was easy to read. He had been
a lawless sea rover in the days when there was both gold
and glory in harrying Spanish towns and galleons, from
Mexico to Peru. The real buccaneers had vanished but
he was too old a dog to learn new tricks and he faithfully
served Stede Bonnet, who had a spark of the chivalry
and manliness which had burned so brightly in that idolized
master, Captain Edward Davis.</p>

<p>As for this blue-eyed smiling young Bill Saxby, he
had been a small tradesman in London. Through no
fault of his own, he was cruelly imprisoned for debt and,
after two years, shipped to the Carolina plantations as
no better than a slave. For all he knew, the girl wife<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and child in London had been suffered to starve. He
had never heard any word of them. As a fugitive he
had been taken aboard a pirate vessel. There he found
kindlier treatment than honest men had ever offered him,
and so grew somewhat reconciled to this wicked calling.</p>

<p>On one of the occasions when Jack left these entertaining
companions to visit his high sentry post in the
tree, he surmised that all hands had been summoned on
the vessel and lifting out her mast. He could see two
boats plying back and forth and filled with men. He
lingered because something else caught his interest.
A little boat was putting out from the seaward side of
the <i>Revenge</i> and it fetched a wide circuit of the harbor.
This brought the ship between it and the sloop
so that its departure would be unobserved by the toiling
crew.</p>

<p>Two men were at the oars and a third sat in the stern.
At a distance, Jack guessed they were bound to one of
the nearest islands, perhaps in search of oysters or crabs,
but after making a long sweep which carried the boat
out of vision of the sloop and the beach, it swung toward
the shore, a little to the northward of the mouth of the
creek. The errand had a stealthy air. Jack Cockrell
started and almost fell out of the tree. He had been
mistaken in his fancy that Blackbeard was in the pinnace
which had towed the prisoners out to be marooned.
This was none other than the grotesque fiend of a pirate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
himself, furtively steering his cock-boat on some private
errand of his own.</p>

<p>As soon as he was certain of this, Jack fairly scurried
down the tree, digging his toes in the bark like a squirrel,
and tumbling head over heels into the pirogue. Breathing
rapidly, he stuttered:</p>

<p>"The&mdash;the devil himself,&mdash;in that little w-wherry of
his,&mdash;c-coming inshore. He must ha' seen the canoe.
He is in chase of me."</p>

<p>"Go take a look, Bill," coolly remarked old Trimble
Rogers, who was busy slapping at mosquitoes. "A
touch o' the sun has bred a nightmare in the lad."</p>

<p>Bill Saxby swarmed up the live-oak like a limber seaman
with fish-hooks for fingers and he, too, almost lost
his balance at what he saw. He waved a warning hand
at the canoe and then put his fingers to his lips. Down
he came in breakneck haste and urged the others to haul
their craft farther up into the sedge. He was plucking
green bushes and armfuls of dried grass to fling across
the gunwales.</p>

<p>Satisfied that the canoe was entirely concealed, they
crouched low. The old man was more concerned with
the pest of insects and he reached out to claw up the
sticky mud with which he plastered his face and neck
like a mask. This seemed to give him some relief and
his comrades were glad to do the same. Bill Saxby was
attentive to the priming of the musket, which he passed
over to Trimble Rogers, saying:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are the chief gunner, old hawk. But hold your
fire. I'm itching to know what trick this Don Whiskerando
is up to."</p>

<p>"Fair enough," muttered the old man. "Cap'n
Bonnet 'ud clap me in irons if I slew this filthy Ed'ard
Teach and robbed him of that enjoyment. I'll pull no
trigger save in our own defense."</p>

<p>They heard the faint splash of oars. Soon the little
cock-boat came gliding around the bend of the shore and
floated into the mouth of the creek. Bill Saxby raised
himself for a moment and ducked swiftly as he whispered:</p>

<p>"He is not lookin' about but motions 'em to row on
up the stream."</p>

<p>"Then our canoe is not what he's after?" murmured
Jack.</p>

<p>"'Tis some queer game. Were he hunting us, he'd
fetch along more hands than them two. Hush! Let
him pass."</p>

<p>The little boat came steadily on, the tide helping the
oars. It sat very low in the water, oddly so for the
weight of three men. Blackbeard, hunched in the stern,
held a pistol in one hand while the other gripped the
tiller. This was not in fear of danger from the shore
because he kept his eyes on the two seamen at the oars
and it was plain to see that the pistol was meant to menace
them.</p>

<p>The boat passed abreast of the pirogue so artfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
concealed in the pocket of a tiny cove. The intervening
distance was no more than a dozen yards. Old Trimble
Rogers wistfully fingered the musket and lifted it to
squint along the barrel. Never was temptation more
sturdily resisted. Then his face, hard as iron and puckered
like dried leather, broke into a smile. The idea
pleased him immensely. They would follow Blackbeard
and watch the chance to take him alive. He who
had trapped his own men in camp was now neatly
trapped himself, his retreat cut off. Tie a couple of
fathom of stout cord to his whiskers and tow him along
by land, all the way to Stede Bonnet's ship. There the
worthy captain could bargain with him at his own terms,
silently chuckled the old buccaneer.</p>

<p>They held their breath and gazed at the fantastic
scoundrel who had made himself the ogre among pirates.
He had discarded the great hat as cumbersome and his
tousled head was bound around with a wide strip of the
red calico from India. Still and solid he sat, like a
heathen idol, staring in front of him and intent on his
mysterious errand. The unseen spectators in the
pirogue scanned also the two seamen at the oars and felt
a vague pity for them. Unmistakably they were sick
with fear. It was conveyed by their dejected aspect,
by the tinge of pallor, by the fixity with which they
regarded the cocked pistol in Blackbeard's fist. Jack
Cockrell knew them as abandoned villains who had
boasted of many a bloody deed but the swarthy, pock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>marked
fellow had been in the boat which had saved the
two lads from the drifting raft. This was enough to
awaken a lively sympathy.</p>

<p>Trimble Rogers gripped Jack's shoulder with a
strength which made him wince and pointed a skinny
finger at the boat. The fate of the two seamen did not
trouble him greatly. Those who lived by violence should
rightly expect to die by it. The sea was their gaming
table and it was their ill luck if the dice were cogged.
Just then Bill Saxby stifled an ejaculation. He, too,
had discovered the freightage in the cock-boat, the heavy
burden which made it swim so low.</p>

<p>It rested in front of Blackbeard's knees, the top showing
above the curve of the gunwales. It was a sea-chest,
uncommonly large, built of some dark tropical wood and
strapped with iron. Old Trimble Rogers' fierce eyes
glittered and he licked his lips. He leaned over to
whisper in Bill Saxby's ear the one word:</p>

<p>"<i>Treasure!</i>"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>BLACKBEARD'S ERRAND IS INTERRUPTED</h3>


<div class='unindent'><big>B</big>LACKBEARD'S deep-laden boat was rowed on
past the pirogue and turned to follow the channel
of the sluggish stream. Bill Saxby thrust aside
the cover of grass and boughs and shoved the log canoe
out of the cove. So crooked was the course of the creek
that the boat was already out of sight and by stealthy
paddling it was possible to pursue undetected. Old
Trimble Rogers had forgotten his lust to slay Blackbeard.
His gloating imagination could picture the contents
of that massive sea-chest after a long cruise in
southern waters.</div>

<p>It was foolish to attempt to surprise Blackbeard while
afloat in the creek. In a race of it, the handy cock-boat
could pull away from the clumsier pirogue manned by
two paddles only, for Trimble Rogers was needed to
steer and be ready with the musket. This was their only
firearm, which Bill Saxby had snatched up during the
flight from the camp. At the same time he had lifted
a powder-horn and bullet pouch from a wounded pirate.</p>

<p>"If I do bang away and miss him," grumbled Trimble
Rogers, "he's apt to pepper us afore I can reload."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you forswore shootin' him," chided Bill Saxby,
between strokes of the paddle.</p>

<p>"Show me a great sea-chest crammed wi' treasure and
I'd put a hole through the Grand High Panjandrum
hisself," replied the ancient one. "Aye, Bill, there be
more'n one way to skin an eel. We'll lay aboard this
bloody blow-hard of a Cap'n Teach whilst he's a-buryin'
of it. Here may well be where he has tucked away his
other plunder. What if we bag the whole of it?"</p>

<p>"One more fling, eh, Trimble, and more gold than ye
lugged on your back from Guayaquil," grinned young
Bill.</p>

<p>They had spoken in cautious tones and now held their
tongues. The paddles dipped with no more than a
trickle of water and the canoe hugged the marsh. They
were close to the next bend of the stream and the sound
of the oars in the cock-boat was faintly audible. As the
tallest of the three, the old man stood up after swathing
his head in dried grass, and gazed across the curve of the
shore. By signs he told his companions that Blackbeard
was bound farther up the stream.</p>

<p>They waited a little, giving their quarry time to pass
beyond another turn of the channel. Jack Cockrell was
embarked on the most entrancing excursion of his life.
This repaid him for all he had suffered. His only regret
was that poor Joe Hawkridge had been marooned
before he could share this golden adventure. However,
he would see that Joe received a handsome amount of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
treasure. Trimble Rogers was muttering again, and
thus he angrily expounded a grievance:</p>

<p>"A thief is this Cap'n Teach,&mdash;like a wild hog, all
greed and bristles. 'Tis the custom of honest buccaneers
and pirates to divide the spoils by the strict rule,&mdash;six
shares for the commander, two for the master's mate,
and other officers accordin' to their employment, with
one share to every seaman alike. Think ye this bloody
pick-purse dealt fairly by his crew? In yon sea-chest be
the lawful shares of all the woesome lads he marooned
this day. An' as much more as he durst skulk away
with."</p>

<p>"Easy, now, old Fire-and-Brimstone," warned Bill,
"or that temper will gain the upper hand. Don't spoil
the show by bombardin' Blackbeard with that cross-eyed
musket."</p>

<p>Now here was young Master Cockrell, a gentleman
and a near kinsman of a high official who had sworn to
hang every mother's son of a pirate that harried Carolina
waters. And yet this godly youth was eager to lay
hands on Blackbeard's treasure so as to divide it among
the pirates who had been robbed of it. It was a twisted
sense of justice, no doubt, and a code of morals turned
topsy-turvy, but you are entreated to think not too
harshly of such behavior. Master Cockrell had fallen
into almighty bad company but the friends he had made
displayed fidelity and readiness to serve him.</p>

<p>"How far will the chase lead us?" he inquired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you men come down this same creek in the
pirogue?"</p>

<p>"Aye, in this very same mess o' pea soup and jungle,"
answered Bill Saxby. "Two miles in from the coast, at
a venture, was where we stumbled on the canoe and
tossed the Indians out of it. Beyond that the water
spreads o'er the swamp with no fairway for a boat."</p>

<p>Once more they paddled for a short stretch and then
repeated the stratagem of hauling into the dense growth
of the mud-flat and pausing until the cock-boat had
steered beyond the next elbow of the stream. It became
more and more difficult to avoid the fallen trees and
other obstructions, but Blackbeard was threading his
course like a pilot acquainted with this dank and somber
region. The pirogue ceased to lag purposely but had to
be urged in order to keep within striking distance.</p>

<p>Twice they were compelled to climb out and shove
clear of sunken entanglements or slimy shoals. But
when they held themselves to listen, they could still hear
the measured thump of oars against the pins, like the
beat of a distant drum in the brooding silence of this
melancholy solitude. They had struggled on for perhaps
a mile and a half, in all, when Trimble Rogers ordered
another halt. He was perplexed, like a hound
uncertain of the scent. From the left bank of the creek,
a smaller stream meandered blindly off into the swamp.
Into which of these watercourses had Blackbeard continued
his secret voyage?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Again they listened, and more anxiously than ever.
The tell-tale thump of the oars had ceased. The only
sounds in the bayou were the trickle of water from the
tidal pools, the wind in the tree-tops, the rat-tat-tat of a
woodpecker, and the scream of a bob-cat. With a foolish
air of chagrin, Trimble Rogers rubbed his hoary pate
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Whilst Bill and me were a-paddlin' this hollow log
down-stream, we took no heed of a fork like this yonder.
With the sun at our backs to guide us, we knew we was
makin' easterly to fetch the coast. What say, Bill?"</p>

<p>"Cursed if I know. Spin a coin. The treasure has
slipped us."</p>

<p>"Rot me if it has!" snarled the old man. "We'll
push on as we are, in the bigger stream. That stinkin'
ditch on my left hand looks too weedy and shallow to
float a boat."</p>

<p>"It makes no odds. A gamester's choice," amiably
agreed Bill.</p>

<p>They paddled with might and main, flinging caution
to the winds. Jack Cockrell was well versed in handling
one of these dugout canoes and his stout arms made Bill
Saxby grunt and sweat to keep stroke with him. When
the craft grounded they strove like madmen to push it
clear. Trimble Rogers tore the water with a paddle,
straining every sinew and condemning Blackbeard to
the bottomless pit in a queer jargon of the Spanish,
French, and English tongues. It required such a lurid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
vocabulary to give vent to his feelings. He was even
more distressed when he sighted the clump of gum trees
near by which he and Bill had purloined the pirogue.
Beyond this the creek was impassable.</p>

<p>"Throwed a blank! Wear ship and drive back to the
fork o' the waters," shouted the old man. "Hull down
an' under though he be, we'll nab yon <i>picaro</i>, with his
jolly treasure. <i>Rapido, camaradas! Vivo!</i>"</p>

<p>To make haste was easier said than done but the sluggish
current was now in their favor and there was no
more than a half mile to traverse under stress of furious
exertion. The heavy canoe crashed through obstacles
which had delayed the upward journey and they knew
where to avoid the worst of the shoals. What fretted
them was the fear that Blackbeard might have buried the
sea-chest and descended the creek while they were engaged
in this wild-goose chase. But this seemed unlikely
and, moreover, old Trimble Rogers was the man
to nose out the marks of the landing-place and the trail
which must have been left.</p>

<p>Where the two streams joined, the pirogue turned
and shot into the smaller one. To their surprise it presently
widened and was like a tiny lagoon, with the water
much clearer as if fed by springs. The view was less
broken and there were glimpses of dry knolls in the
swamp and verdure not so noxious and tanglesome.
Along the edge of this pretty pond skimmed the pirogue
while Trimble Rogers keenly scanned every inch of it for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the imprint of a boat's keel. A hundred yards and the
water again narrowed to a little creek. Impetuously
the canoe swung to pass around a spit of land covered
with a thicket of sweet bay.</p>

<p>There, no more than a dozen feet beyond, was the captain's
cock-boat from the <i>Revenge</i>. Its bow had been
pulled out of the water which deepened from a shelving
bank. The boat was deserted but above the gunwale
could be seen the iron-bound lid of the massive sea-chest.
Those in the pirogue desired to behold nothing else.
They were suddenly diverted by a tremendous yell which
came booming out of the tall grass where it waved
breast-high on the shore of the stream. A pistol barked
and the ball clipped a straggling lock of Trimble Rogers'
gray hair.</p>

<p>Driving his two seamen before him, Blackbeard
rushed for his boat as fast as the bandy legs and clumsy
sea-boots could carry him. In fancied security he had
explored the nearest knoll. And now appeared this infernal
canoe, surging full-tilt at his treasure chest.</p>

<p>Things happened <i>rapido</i> enough to glut even an old
buccaneer. The consternation in the pirogue prevented
any thought of checking headway with the paddles.
This hollowed cypress log, narrow beamed and solid at
both ends, still moved with a weighty momentum. Its
astounded crew were otherwise occupied. Blackbeard
appeared to have the advantage of them. Jack Cockrell
ducked to the bottom of the canoe. Bill Saxby's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
eyes of baby blue were big and round as saucers as he
wildly flourished his paddle as the only cudgel at hand.</p>

<p>With a whoop-la, old Trimble Rogers leaped to his
feet, the long musket at his shoulder. Before he could
aim at the savage, bushy figure of Blackbeard, the prow
of the pirogue crashed into the side of the cock-boat,
striking it well toward the stern. The ancient freebooter
described a somersault and smote the water with a
mighty splash, musket and all. Blowing like a grampus,
he bobbed to the top, clawing the weeds from his eyes
but still clutching the musket. Nobody paid his misfortune
the slightest heed.</p>

<p>The water deepened suddenly, as has been said, where
the current had scoured the bank. With the nose of the
little boat pulled well up in the mud, the stern sloped
almost level with the surface of the stream. The blunt,
slanting bow of the pirogue banged into the plank gunwale
and slid over it. The force of the blow dragged the
cock-boat to one side and wrenched it free of the shore.
It floated at the end of a tether but the bow of the canoe
pressed the stern under and tipped it until the water
rushed in.</p>

<p>Listed far over, the sea-chest slid a trifle and this was
enough to push the gunwale clear under. The boat
filled and capsized, what with the weight of the chest and
the pressure of the canoe's fore part. Down to the oozy
bed sank Blackbeard's treasure.</p>

<p>The arch-pirate himself came charging out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
marsh-grass in time to witness this lamentable disaster.
His hoarse ejaculations were too dreadful for a Christian
reader's ears. Dumfounded for an instant, he gathered
his wits to fire another pistol at the pirogue. The ball
flew wild, as was to be expected of a marksman in a state
of mind so distraught. He had overlooked those two
poor seamen of his who had been impressed to bury the
treasure, after which they were presumably to be pistoled
or knocked on the head. Dead men told no tales.
Doomed wretches, they were quick to snatch from this
confusion the precious hope of life.</p>

<p>The pockmarked fellow, who was powerfully built,
whirled like a cat as he heard Blackbeard's pistol discharged
just behind him. There was no time to draw
and cock another pistol. The seaman fairly flew at the
pirate captain's throat. Down they toppled and vanished
in the grass together. A moment later Blackbeard
bounded to his feet, a bloody dirk in his hand. He had
done for the poor fellow who lay groaning where he fell.
Terrified by this, the other seaman wheeled and fled to
the bank of the creek, seeking the pirogue as his only
refuge.</p>

<p>He leaped for it but his feet slipped in the treacherous
mud and his impetus was checked so that he tumbled
forward, striking the solid side of the dugout with great
force. He was splashing in the water but his exertions
were feeble. Either the collision had stunned him or he
was unable to swim. Bill Saxby and Jack Cockrell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
were trying to swing the canoe clear of the boat and
effect a landing. Trimble Rogers had rescued himself
from the creek and was ramming a dry charge into his
dripping musket. Blackbeard was a deadly menace and
their attention was fixed on him.</p>

<p>When they endeavored to lend a hand to the helpless
seaman he had sunk beneath the surface of the roily
stream. They saw him come up and turn a ghastly face
to them, but he went down like a stone before a hand
could clutch at him. A few bubbles and this was the
end of him. Jack Cockrell hesitated with a brave impulse
to dive in search of him although he knew the bottom
was a tangle of rotted trees, but just then Bill
Saxby yelled to him to follow ashore with a paddle for a
weapon. The luckless seaman was already drowned,
this was as good as certain, and Jack jumped from the
pirogue.</p>

<p>Blackbeard had halted his onrush and he wavered
when he beheld stout Bill Saxby within a few strides of
him and long Trimble Rogers galloping through the
grass with his musket. Another pistol shot or two would
not stop these three antagonists and a buffet from one of
those hewn paddles would dash out a man's brains. The
most ferocious of all pirates for once preferred to run
away and live to fight another day. His boat denied
him, he whirled about to plunge through the tall, matted
grass. He was running in the direction of the dry knoll
whence he had appeared.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Infuriated by the fate of the two seamen, Trimble
Rogers made a try at shooting him on the wing but the
musket ball failed to find the mark. It was necessary to
hunt him down for the sake of their own safety. They
might have gone their way in the pirogue but this would
have been to abandon the sea-chest without an effort to
drag it up or fix its location.</p>

<p>Now it might seem an easy matter for these pursuers,
two of them young and active, to run down this fugitive
Blackbeard, encumbered as he was by middle age and
dissipation. They put after him boldly, with little fear
of his pistols. In this dense cover he would have to fire
at them haphazard and he was unlikely to tarry and wait
for them. They saw him in glimpses as he fled from one
grassy patch to another, or burst out of a leafy thicket,
the great beard streaming over his shoulders like studding-sails,
the red turban of calico a vivid blotch of color.</p>

<p>Nimble as they were, however, they failed to overtake
him. This was because he was familiar with this landscape
of bog and hummock and pine knoll. Jack Cockrell
fell into a hidden quagmire and had to be fished out
by main strength. Bill Saxby was caught amidst the
tenacious vines, like a bull by the horns, and old Trimble
came a cropper in a patch of saw-tooth palmetto.
They straggled to the nearest knoll after Blackbeard
had crossed it. Then he followed a ridge which led in
the direction of another of these dry islands.</p>

<p>The pursuers halted to gaze from this slight elevation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
There was not a solitary glimpse of the crimson turban.
Trimble Rogers plowed through the prickly ash, short
of wind and temper, with the musket again ready for
action. His language was hot enough to flash the powder
in the pan.</p>

<p>"Lost him a'ready, ye lubbers, whilst I fetched up the
rear?" he scolded. "Leave the old dog to find the trail.
I be hanged if I take him alive for Stede Bonnet. What
say, Bill? Skin and stuff him for a trophy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"First catch the slippery son o' Satan," tartly answered
Bill. "He hides away like a hare. You can
track him, no doubt, Trimble, but the sun will be down
ere long. I'll not pass the night in this cursed puddle
of a place."</p>

<p>Just then Jack Cockrell roved far enough to find on
the knoll a small pit freshly dug, with a spade and pick
beside it. Like excited children, his two comrades ran
to inspect the hole which Blackbeard's seamen had dug
ready for the treasure chest. Then they scattered to
explore the knoll in search of signs to indicate where
previous hoards might have been buried. Trimble
Rogers scouted like a red Indian, eager to find traces of
upturned earth, or the leaf mould disturbed, or marks
of an axe on the pine trees as symbols of secret guidance.
It was a futile quest, possibly because the high spring
tides, when swept by easterly gales, had now and then
crept back from the coast to cover the knoll and obliterate
man's handiwork.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Like a hunter bewitched, the gray buccaneer was absorbed
in this rare pastime until Bill Saxby exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Is there no wit in our addled pates? Quit this
dashed folly! What of the treasure chest that was
spilled from the boat?"</p>

<p>"It won't take wings. Wait a bit," growled Trimble.
"<i>Madre de Dios</i>, but there must be more of it
here. This truant Cap'n Teach knew the road well.
Did ye mark how he doubled for the knoll, like a fox to
its hole?"</p>

<p>Jack Cockrell ended the argument when he spoke up,
with a shamefaced air:</p>

<p>"We are three heartless men! One of the seamen is
drowned, rest his soul, and we could not save the poor
wretch. But the other fellow was stabbed and lies in the
grass near the stream. For all we know, there may be
life in him."</p>

<p>"Heartless? 'Tis monstrous of us," cried Bill Saxby.
"This greed for pirates' gold is like a poison."</p>

<p>They hastened to retrace their steps. The wounded
seaman was breathing his last when they reached his side.
They could not have prolonged his life had they remained
with him. Jack Cockrell stroked his damp forehead
and murmured:</p>

<p>"Farewell to ye, Jesse Strawn. Any message before
you slip your cable?"</p>

<p>There was a faint whisper of:</p>

<p>"Scuppered, lad! Take warnin' and avast this cruel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
piratin' or you'll get it. A few words from the Bible
'ud ease me off."</p>

<p>To Jack's amazement, the veteran sinner of the lot,
old Trimble Rogers, fumbled in his breeches and withdrew
a small book carefully wrapped in canvas. Solemnly
he hooked behind his ears a pair of huge, horn-rimmed
spectacles and knelt beside the dying pirate. In
the manner of a priest the buccaneer intoned a chapter
of Holy Writ which he appeared to know by rote. Then
he said a prayer in a powerful broken voice. Silence
followed. The others waited with bared heads until
Trimble said:</p>

<p>"His soul has passed. Shall we give the poor lad a
decent burial?"</p>

<p>"His grave is ready. He helped dig it himself," said
Bill Saxby. "And may his ghost be a torment to the
fiend that slew him."</p>

<p>It seemed a fitting suggestion. In the freshly made
treasure pit on the knoll they laid the dead pirate and
used the spade to cover him. Jack Cockrell had a sheath
knife with which he fashioned a rude cross and hacked
on it:</p>

<div class='center'>
JESSE STRAWN<br />
A. D. 1718<br />
</div>

<p>"Aye, his ghost will flit to plague this Cap'n Teach,"
said Trimble Rogers. "We can leave Jesse Strawn to
square his own account. Now for the sea-chest, though
I misdoubt we can fish it up."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE SEA URCHIN AND THE CARPENTER'S MATE</h3>


<div class='unindent'><big>F</big>OR the sake of a treasure sordid and blood-stained,
it would seem shabby to overlook the fate
of hapless Joe Hawkridge marooned along with
the hands of the <i>Revenge</i> who were suspected of plotting
mutiny. His behavior was courageous and unselfish,
for he could have fled back into the swamp when
Blackbeard's wily attack threw the camp into tumult.
From a sense of duty he flung himself into the fray.
What friends he had in the ship were those of the decenter
sort who were tired of wanton brutalities and of
a master who was no better than a lunatic.</div>

<p>When the sloop opened fire with her guns, it was time
to surrender. Unhurt save for a few scratches and a
gorgeous black eye, Joe was dragged to the beach and
thrown into a boat. Promptly the armed pinnace took
them in tow, as arranged beforehand. Several of the
prisoners had visited this rendezvous at Cherokee Inlet
during a previous cruise and had some knowledge of the
lay of the coast. Five or six miles out were certain
shoals of sand scarcely lifted above high tide, so desolate
that nothing whatever grew upon them nor was there
any means of obtaining fresh water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"A pretty fancy,&mdash;to cast us where he can enjoy the
sight of it when the ship sails out," said one of them who
held a wounded comrade in his arms.</p>

<p>"Some trading vessel may sight us in the nick o'
time," hopefully suggested Joe. "Never say die!"</p>

<p>"Trust most honest skippers to give the Inlet a wide
berth," was the lugubrious reply. "This harbor was
used by pirates afore Blackbeard's time. I was a silly
'prentice-boy, same as you, Joe, wi' Cap'n Willum Kidd
when we lay in here to caulk his galley for the long voyage
to Madagascar."</p>

<p>"A poor figger of a pirate was that same Kidd,"
spoke up another. "He ne'er scuttled a ship nor fought
an action. An' his treasure was all in my eye. What
did he swing for, at Execution Dock? For crackin' the
skull of his gunner with a wooden bucket."</p>

<p>"They can't h'ist this Cap'n Teach to the same gibbet
any too soon to please me, Sam," croaked a horse-faced
rogue with two fingers chopped off. "He's gone and
murdered all us men, as sure as blazes."</p>

<p>Joe Hawkridge held his peace and wondered what
had become of his partner, Jack Cockrell, waiting alone
in the pirogue. In the infernal commotion at the camp,
Joe had failed to note whether Bill Saxby and Trimble
Rogers had betaken themselves off or had been among
those killed. There was the faint hope that these trusty
messengers might find their way back to Captain Stede
Bonnet's ship and so hasten his coming.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>The boats crept over the burnished surface of the harbor
and passed the nearest islands which were green and
wooded. Beyond them shone the gently heaving sea,
with the distant gleam of a patch of sandy shoal ringed
about with a necklace of surf. It was remote enough
from any other land to daunt the strongest swimmer.
The boats kept on until they had rounded to leeward of
this ghastly prison. There was no means of resistance.
The captives were driven ashore by force of arms, carrying
a few of their wounded with them.</p>

<p>With emotions beyond the power of speech, they
stared at the pinnace as the oars splashed on the return
journey to the <i>Revenge</i>. Joe Hawkridge wept a little,
perplexed that men could be so cruel to their own shipmates.
And yet what could be expected of pirates debased
enough to be Blackbeard's loyal followers? Recovering
from their first stupor, the twenty able-bodied
survivors began to ransack the strip of naked sand on
which they had been marooned. It was no more than
an acre in extent. A few small fish were found in a pool
left by the falling tide and perhaps a hundred turtle
eggs were uncovered during the afternoon. This merely
postponed starvation.</p>

<p>There was not much bickering. In the shadow of certain
death, these outlaws of the sea seemed to have acquired
a spirit of resignation which was akin to dignity.
They had lost the game. In their own lingo, it was the
black spot for all hands of 'em. With the coolness of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
night they revived to bathe in the surf which made their
thirst less hard to bear. There was not much sleep.
Men walked in restless circles, looking up at the stars,
muttering to themselves, or scanning the sea which had
known their crimes and follies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 409px;">
<img src="images/illus6.jpg" width="409" height="500" alt="THEY CAPERED AND HUGGED EACH OTHER" title="THEY CAPERED AND HUGGED EACH OTHER" />
<span class="caption">THEY CAPERED AND HUGGED EACH OTHER</span>
</div>

<p>Joe Hawkridge scooped out a bed for himself in the
sand and dropped off to sleep by spells, with dreams of
ease and quiet ashore and learning to be a gentleman.
It was daylight when shouts startled him. The other
derelicts were in a frenzy of agitation. They capered
and hugged each other, and made unearthly sounds.
Joe brushed the sand from his eyes and saw a small
vessel approaching the tiny island. Her rig was made
out to be that of a snow, which was very like a brig,
the difference being in the larger main-topsail and the
absence of a spanker or after steering-sail.</p>

<p>Such trading craft as this snow came coasting down
from Salem and other New England ports to Virginia
and the Carolinas laden with molasses, rum, salt, cider,
mackerel, woodenware, Muscavado sugar, and dried
codfish. They bartered for return cargoes and carried
no specie, wherefore pirates like Stede Bonnet seldom
molested them excepting to take such stores as might be
needed and sometimes actually to pay for them. They
were the prey of miscreants of Blackbeard's stripe who
destroyed and slew for the pleasure of it.</p>

<p>This trim little snow was making to the southward in
fancied security, having picked up a landfall, as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
marooned pirates conjectured. No doubt her master
had failed to receive warning that Blackbeard was in
these waters and he was running his risk of encountering
other marauders. He must have seen that there were
people in distress on the tide-washed strip of sand. The
snow shifted her helm and fired a gun. The marooned
wretches could scarce credit their amazing good fortune
but a grave, slow-spoken fellow who had been a carpenter's
mate in the <i>Revenge</i> thought the rejoicing premature.</p>

<p>"When that God-fearin' skipper takes a look at us,
he will sheer off and clap on sail, lads. For shipwrecked
sailors you are a pizen lot o' mugs. The only blighted
one of ye what's the leastwise respectable is me."</p>

<p>Here was a terrible misgiving which clouded the
bright anticipations. They were, indeed, an unlovely
cargo for the little trading vessel to take on board. One
of them whipped out a pair of scissors and hastily sawed
at his unkempt whiskers while his comrades stood in line
and waited their turn. Others discarded gaudy kerchiefs
and pistol-belts, or kicked off Spanish jack-boots.
Scraps of gold lace were also unpopular. But they
could not get rid of scarred faces and rum-reddened
noses and the other hall-marks of their trade.</p>

<p>To their immense relief, the snow displayed no signs
of alarm but sailed as close as the shoaling water permitted
and dipped her colors. The pirates flattered
themselves that they were not as frightful as the car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>penter's
mate had painted them. And this New England
shipmaster was a merciful man who would not
leave his fellow mortals to perish. They saw a boat lowered
from the snow and into it jumped half a dozen
sailors, soberly clad in dungaree, with round straw hats
on their heads. With a gush of gratitude, the pirates
swore to deal courteously by these noble merchant
mariners and to repay them in whatever manner possible.</p>

<p>Out into the murmuring surf rushed the mild-mannered
rascals, eager to grasp the boat and haul it up.
It was Joe Hawkridge, hovering in the background,
who raised the first cry of astonishment. His voice was
so affrighted that it quavered. Before the boat was
half-way from the vessel, he perceived that these were
no sedate seamen from the Massachusetts Colony, even
though they were in dungaree and round straw hats.
He was gazing at some of Ned Rackham's evil pirates
whom he had last beheld on the shattered deck of the
<i>Plymouth Adventure</i> where they had been left to build
a raft for themselves!</p>

<p>The devil had looked after his own. They had floated
away from the stranded ship and instead of landing on
the beach had been rescued by this unfortunate snow
whose crew had been disposed of in some violent manner.
This much Joe Hawkridge comprehended, although his
mind was awhirl. He was better off marooned. He
had helped to turn the guns of the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
against these very same men when they had been blown
out of the after cabin and the ship retaken by Captain
Jonathan Wellsby.</p>

<p>Whatever other plans they had in store, the first business
would be to kill Joe Hawkridge. This was painfully
obvious. He retreated still farther behind his
companions and had a confused idea of digging into the
sand and burying himself from view. The discovery
that these were Blackbeard's pirates in the boat created
general confusion but there was no fear of instant death.
It was a situation excessively awkward for the marooned
company but nevertheless open to parley and argument.</p>

<p>By hurried agreement, the carpenter's mate, Peter
Tobey by name, was chosen as spokesman. Before he
began to talk with the men in the boat, Joe Hawkridge
called to him in piteous accents and begged him to step
back in rear of the crowd for a moment. Tobey
shouted to the boat to wait outside the surf and not attempt
a landing.</p>

<p>"What's the row, Joe?" he asked, with a kindly
smile. "'Tis a disappointment for all of us,&mdash;this tangle
with Rackham's crew,&mdash;but why any worse for
you?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell it all, Peter, but my life is forfeit once
they lay hands on me."</p>

<p>"What tarradiddle is this? As I remember it in the
<i>Revenge</i>, when all hands of us were cruisin' together,
ye had no mortal enemies."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"It happened in the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>," answered
Joe. "There be men in yon boat that 'ud delight in
flayin' me alive. I swear it, Peter, by my mother's
name. Give me up, and my blood is on your head."</p>

<p>The boy's words carried conviction. The stolid carpenter's
mate pondered and knitted his bushy brows.</p>

<p>"I never did a wilful murder yet," said he. "Mallet
and chisel come readier to my fist than a cutlass. Bide
here, Joe. Let me get my bearings. This has the look
of a ticklish matter for the lot of us. I shall be keepin' a
weather eye lifted for squalls."</p>

<p>In mortal fear of discovery by the men in the boat,
Joe flattened himself behind a palmetto log which had
drifted to the other side of the island. Here he was
hidden unless the boat should make a landing. The
carpenter's mate waded out to join his companions who
were amiably conversing with Ned Rackham's pirates.
They had all been shipmates either in the <i>Revenge</i> or
the <i>Triumph</i> sloop and there was boisterous curiosity
concerning the divers adventures while they had been
apart. Rackham's crew had been reduced to eighteen
men when they were lucky enough to capture the snow,
it was learned. With this small company he dared not
go pirating on his own account and so had decided to
rejoin Blackbeard.</p>

<p>"Is Ned Rackham aboard the snow?" asked Peter
Tobey of the boat's coxswain.</p>

<p>"He is all o' that, matey, though the big bos'n of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
<i>Plymouth Adventure</i> shoved a knife in his ribs to the
hilt. He is flat in a bunk but he gives the orders an'
it's jump at the word."</p>

<p>"A hard man to kill," said Peter Tobey. "Take me
aboard. 'Tis best I have speech with him. Let the
people wait here on the cay. They can stand another
hour of it."</p>

<p>There was fierce protest among the marooned pirates
but the carpenter's mate gruffly demanded to know if
they wished to be carried into the harbor and turned
over to Blackbeard. This gave the mob something to
think about and they permitted the boat to pull away
from them without much objection.</p>

<p>"A rough joke on you lads, I call it, to be dumped
on this bit o' purgatory," said the coxswain to Peter
Tobey. "The great Cap'n Teach must ha' been in one
of his tantrums."</p>

<p>"It had been long brewing, as ye know," answered
the carpenter's mate. "These men with you in the snow
'ud sooner follow Ned Rackham, flint-hearted though he
be, than to rejoin the <i>Revenge</i>."</p>

<p>"Not so loud," cautioned the coxswain. "We'll see
which way the cat is going to jump. Us poor devils
is sore uneasy at findin' how you were dealt with."</p>

<p>"What of the master and crew of the snow?" asked
Tobey. "Were they snuffed out? That 'ud be Rackham's
way."</p>

<p>"No, we set 'em off in a boat, within sight of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
coast. Ned Rackham was too shrewd to bloody his
hands, bein' helpless in this tub of a snow which could
neither fight nor show her heels if she was chased."</p>

<p>Few men as there were aboard the snow, they were
smartly disciplined and kept things shipshape, as Peter
Tobey noted when he climbed on deck. A few minutes
later he was summoned into the small cabin. Propped
up in the skipper's berth, Sailing-Master Ned Rackham
had a pinched and ghastly look. He was a young man,
with clean-cut, handsome features, and a certain refinement
of manner when he cared to assume it. The
rumor was that he was the black sheep of an English
house of some distinction and that he had enlisted in the
Royal Navy under a false name.</p>

<p>"What is this mare's-nest, my good Tobey?" said he
as the carpenter's mate stood diffidently fumbling with
his cap. "Marooned? Twenty men of you on a reef
of sand? Were ye naughty boys whilst I was absent?"</p>

<p>"No more than them I could name who planned to go
a-cruisin' in the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>," doggedly replied
Peter Tobey who resented the tone of sneering
patronage.</p>

<p>"Fie, fie! You talk boldly for a man in your situation.
Never mind! Why the honor of this visit?"</p>

<p>"To make terms, Master Rackham. If us twenty
men consent to serve you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You babble of terms?" was the biting interruption.
"I can leave you to perish on the sand, as ye no doubt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
deserve, or I can carry you in with me, when I report
to Captain Teach."</p>

<p>"But there's another choice, which hasn't escaped
you," persisted the intrepid carpenter's mate. "Enlist
us in your service and you'll have nigh on forty men.
This snow mounts a few old swivels and you must ha'
found muskets in her. With forty men, Master Rackham,
there's no occasion to bow to Blackbeard's whimsies.
You can h'ist the Jolly Roger for yourself and lay
'longside a bigger ship to take and cruise in. I've heard
tell of a great buccaneer that started for himself in a
pinnace and captured a galleon as tall as a church."</p>

<p>Ned Rackham's eyes flashed. Indeed, this was what
he had in mind. This score of recruits would make
the venture worth undertaking. Men were essential.
Given enough of them to handle the snow and a boarding
party besides, and he would not hesitate to shift
helm and bear away to sea again.</p>

<p>"You will sign articles, then?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Aye, I can speak for all, Master Rackham. What
else is there for us? Hold fast, I would except one man.
He must be granted safe conduct, on your sacred honor."</p>

<p>"His name, Tobey?"</p>

<p>"That matters not. Pledge me first. He has no
more stomach for piracy and will be set ashore at some
port."</p>

<p>"A pig in a poke?" cried Rackham, with an ugly
smile. "If I refuse, what?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will have sulky men that may turn against you
some day."</p>

<p>"And I can leave you to rot where you are, with your
nonsense of 'making terms,'" was the harsh rejoinder.</p>

<p>"But you won't do that," argued Peter Tobey.
"Your own fortune hangs on enlisting us twenty lads.
You bear Blackbeard no more love than we do."</p>

<p>Ned Rackham was making no great headway with
this stubborn carpenter's mate who was playing strong
cards of his own.</p>

<p>"A drawn bout, Tobey," said he, with a change of
front. "No more backing and filling. You ask a small
favor. Fetch your man along, whoever he may be. He
shall be done no harm by me."</p>

<p>"Even though he made a mortal enemy of you, Master
Rackham?"</p>

<p>"Enough, Peter. I have many enemies and scores to
settle. You have my assurance but I demand the lad's
name."</p>

<p>"Not without his permission," declared Tobey. "Set
me ashore and I will confer with him."</p>

<p>Grudgingly Rackham consented, unwilling to have a
hitch in the negotiations. In a somber humor, the carpenter's
mate returned to his impatient comrades on the
island. They crowded about him and he briefly delivered
the message, that they were desired to cruise under
Ned Rackham's flag. This delighted them, as the only
way out of a fatal dilemma. Then Tobey went over to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
sit down upon the palmetto log behind which Joe Hawkridge
still sprawled like a turtle. The anxious boy
poked up his head to say:</p>

<p>"What cheer, Peter? A plaguey muddle you found
it, I'll bet."</p>

<p>"Worse'n that, Joe. Rackham wouldn't clinch it
with his oath unless I told him your name. I plead with
him for safe conduct."</p>

<p>"I'd not trust his oath on a stack o' Bibles, once he
set eyes on me," exclaimed Joe. "As soon put my fist
to my own death warrant as go aboard with him."</p>

<p>"That may be," said Peter Tobey, "but you will
have friends. You can't expect us to refuse to sail on
account o' you."</p>

<p>"Leave me here, then," cried the boy. "I'll not call
it deserting me. Take your men aboard the snow. Tell
Ned Rackham you have the fellow amongst 'em who
implored the safe conduct. Pick out some harmless lad
that was saucy to Rackham in the <i>Revenge</i>, a half-wit
like that Robinson younker that was the sailing-master's
own cabin boy. He was allus blubberin' that Rackham
'ud kill him some day."</p>

<p>"No half-wit about you," admiringly quoth the
carpenter's mate. "But, harkee, Joe, you will die in
slow misery. Better a quick bullet from Rackham's
pistol."</p>

<p>"Find some way to send off a little food and water,
Peter, and I will set tight on this desert island. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
mayhap you will dance at the end of a rope afore I
shuffle off."</p>

<p>"A hard request, Joe," replied the puzzled Tobey.
"Unless I can come off again with some of our own
men, how can it be done? Let Rackham's crew suspect
I am leaving a man behind and they will rout you out."</p>

<p>"And they all love me, like a parson loves a pirate,"
grinned Joe. "I shot 'em full of spikes and bolts from
a nine-pounder in the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>."</p>

<p>"I shall use my best endeavor, so help me," sighed
Peter Tobey. "What for did I ever quit carpenterin'
to go a-piratin'? 'Tis the worst basket of chips that
ever was."</p>

<p>"No sooner do I crawl out of one hole than I tumble
into another," very truthfully observed Joe Hawkridge.
"Insomuch as I've allus crawled out, you and me'll
shed no more tears, Peter. There's a kick in me yet."</p>

<p>The disconsolate carpenter's mate returned to his fellow
pirates and bade them go off to the snow. First,
however, he extracted from every man the solemn promise
that he would not divulge the secret of Joe Hawkridge's
presence nor reveal the fact that he had remained
behind. They were eager to promise anything. Several
of them stole over to tell him furtive farewells.
They displayed no great emotion. The trade they followed
was not apt to make them turn soft over such a
tragic episode as this.</p>

<p>When the snow was ready to take her departure, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
almost forty seasoned pirates to seek their fortunes
anew, the wind died to a calm and the little vessel drifted
within easy vision of the sandy island through a long
afternoon. Peter Tobey tormented himself to find some
pretext for smuggling food and water ashore. He invented
a tale of a precious gold snuff-box which must
have fallen out of his pocket and begged permission to
go and search for it. But Ned Rackham sent up word
that he had no notion of being delayed by a fool's errand,
should a breeze spring up. He was not at all
anxious to linger so close to Cherokee Inlet whence
Blackbeard might sight the spars of the snow and perhaps
weigh anchor in the <i>Revenge</i>.</p>

<p>Soon after dark the sails filled with a soft wind which
drew the snow clear of the coast. Peter Tobey had been
mightily busy with an empty cask. In it he stowed meat
and biscuit and a bag of onions, stealthily abstracted
from the storeroom while his own companions stood
guard against surprise. This stuff was packed around
two jugs of water tightly stoppered. Then Peter
headed up the cask with professional skill and watched
the opportunity to lower it from the vessel's bow where
he was unseen.</p>

<p>The wind and tide were favorable to carrying the cask
in the direction of the little patch of sea-washed sand
upon which was marooned the solitary young mariner,
Joe Hawkridge. The carpenter's mate saw the cask
drift past the side of the snow and roll in the silvery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
wake. Slowly it vanished in the darkness and he said
to himself, in a prayer devoutly earnest:</p>

<p>"That boy deserves a slant o' luck, and may the good
God let him have it this once. Send the cask to the
beach, and I vow to go a-piratin' never again."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>JACK JOURNEYS AFOOT</h3>


<div class='unindent'><big>I</big>T is often said that a thing is not lost if you know
where it is. This was Jack Cockrell's opinion concerning
that weighty sea-chest which had splashed
to the bottom of the sluggish stream in the heart of the
Cherokee swamp. With young Bill Saxby and eager
old Trimble Rogers he hastened from the grave of the
pirate seaman whom they had buried on the knoll and
fetched up at the shore where the pirogue had been left.
Beside it floated Blackbeard's boat filled with water.</div>

<p>Having cut two or three long poles, they sounded the
depth and prodded in the muddy bed to find the treasure
chest. It had sunk no more than eight feet below the
surface, as the tide then stood, which was not much over
the head of a tall man. The end of a pole struck something
solid, after considerable poking about. It was
not rough, like a sunken log, and further investigation
with the poles convinced them that they were thumping
the lid of the chest.</p>

<p>"D'ye suppose you could muster breath to dive and
bend a line to one o' the handles, Master Cockrell?"
suggested Trimble Rogers. "Here's a coil of stout
stuff in Cap'n Teach's boat what he used for a painter."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"The bottom of the creek is too befouled," promptly
objected Jack, "and I confess it daunts me to think of
meeting that drownded corpse down there. Try it yourself,
if you like."</p>

<p>"I be needed above water to handle the musket if
Blackbeard sneaks back to bang at us with his pistols,"
was the evasive reply. The mention of the corpse had
given old Trimble a distaste for the task. To his petulant
question, Bill Saxby protested that he couldn't
swim a blessed stroke and he sensibly added:</p>

<p>"What if you did get a rope's end belayed to a handle
of the chest? Even if the strain didn't part the line, we
couldn't heave away in this tipsy canoe. And I am
blamed certain we can't drag the chest ashore lackin'
purchase and tackles."</p>

<p>"The smell o' treasure warps my judgment," grumpily
confessed Trimble Rogers. "We ain't properly
rigged to h'ist that chest from where she lays, and that's
the fact."</p>

<p>"Give us the gear and we'd have it out and cracked
open as pretty as you please," said Bill. "Set up a
couple o' spars for shears, stay 'em from the bank, rig
double blocks, and grapplin' irons for a diver to work
with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which is exactly what Cap'n Teach will be doin'
of when he finds his ship again," lamented the buccaneer.</p>

<p>"He will be some time findin' his ship afoot," grimly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
chuckled Bill. "We have naught to smash his boat
with, but we'll just take it along with us."</p>

<p>"If we make haste to report to Captain Stede Bonnet,"
spoke up Jack Cockrell, "he may make sail in
time to give Blackbeard other things to think on than
this treasure chest. And it is my notion that the need
of fitting the <i>Revenge</i> for action is too urgent to spare
a crew to attempt this errand."</p>

<p>"We shall have it yet," cried Trimble, much consoled.
"And Stede Bonnet'll blithely furnish the men
and gear. For a mere babe, Master Cockrell, ye leak
wisdom like a colander. Our duty is to tarry no longer
at this mad business."</p>

<p>"The first sound word I've heard out of the old barnacle,
eh, Jack?" said Bill Saxby. "We must be out
of this swamp by night and layin' a course for Cap'n
Bonnet and the <i>Royal James</i>."</p>

<p>"Whilst you empty Blackbeard's boat of water so we
can tow it, let me make a rude chart," was Jack's happy
idea. "Some mishap or other may overtake us ere we
get the chance to seek the treasure again. And our own
memory of this pest-hole of a swamp may trick us."</p>

<p>Bill Saxby's tattered diary supplied a scrap of paper
and Jack dug charred splinters from the inside of the
canoe which enabled him to draw a charcoal sketch or
map. It traced the smaller stream from the fork where
it had branched off, the stretch in which it widened like
a tiny lagoon or bayou, and the point of shore just be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>yond
which the pirogue had unexpectedly rammed
Blackbeard's boat. A cross designated the spot where
the treasure chest had sunk in eight feet of water.</p>

<p>The knoll and the grave of Seaman Jesse Strawn
were also indicated, with the distance estimated in
paces and the bearings set down by the position of the
sun.</p>

<p>"There," said Jack, well pleased with his handiwork,
"and once we are aboard ship, I can make fair copies
on parchment, one for each of us."</p>

<p>"Thankee, lad," gratefully exclaimed Trimble
Rogers who now had something to live for. "'Twas a
fond dream o' mine, when I sailed wi' the great Cap'n
Edward Davis in the South Sea, some day to blink at a
chart what showed where the gold was hid."</p>

<p>They were, indeed, recovered from the intoxication of
treasure and recalled to realizing the obligation that was
upon them. They had swerved from it but now they
pressed forward to finish the appointed journey. The
canoe moved down to the fork of the waters with the
light cock-boat skittering in its wake and perhaps the
unhappy Blackbeard, stranded in the swamp, hurled
after them a volley of those curses for which he was renowned.
Once Jack Cockrell laughed aloud, explaining
to his laboring comrades:</p>

<p>"Captain Teach will be combing the burrs from his
grand beard when he boards his ship again. He may
get hung by the chin in a thicket."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's sure to spend this night in the swamp, blast
him," earnestly observed Bill, "and the mosquitoes'll
riddle his hide."</p>

<p>"And may Jesse Strawn lose no time in hauntin'
him," said Trimble Rogers.</p>

<p>There was an hour of daylight to spare when they
had ascended the larger creek as far as the canoe could
be paddled. There they disembarked and hid the dugout
and the cock-boat in the overhanging bushes where
they could be found again in case of a forced retreat.
Bill and Jack burdened themselves with the sack of food
and the water jug while the old buccaneer set out in the
lead as a guide. It was irksome progress for a time, but
gradually the ground became drier and the foliage was
more open. Dusk found them safely emerged from the
great Cherokee swamp and in a pleasant forest of long-leaf
pine with a carpet of brown needles.</p>

<p>In fear of Indians, they dared not kindle a fire and
so stretched themselves in their wet and muddy rags
and slept like dead men. What awakened Jack Cockrell
before sunrise was a series of groans from Trimble
Rogers who sat with his back against a tree while he
rubbed his legs. Ashamed at being heard, he grumpily
explained:</p>

<p>"Cord and faggot 'ud torment me no worse than
this hell-begotten rheumatism. I be free of it in a ship
but the land reeks with foul vapors. It hurt me cruel
at Cartagena in the year of&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"But can you walk all day, in such misery as that?"
anxiously interrupted Jack.</p>

<p>"If not, I'll make shift to crawl," said the old sea
dog.</p>

<p>It was apparent to Jack and also to Bill Saxby that
the ordeal of the swamp had crippled their companion
whose bodily strength had been overtaxed. They debated
whether to try to return to the coast and risk a
voyage in the canoe but Trimble Rogers swore by all
the saints in the calendar that he was done with the
pestilent swamp. He would push on in spite of the
rheumatism. His hardy spirit was unbroken. And so
they resumed the march, the suffering buccaneer hobbling
with the musket as a staff or with a strong arm
supporting him.</p>

<p>Halts were frequent and progress very slow. Now
and then they had glimpses of the blue sea and so knew
that they held the course true. It had been reckoned
that two days would suffice to bring them to the bay in
which Stede Bonnet's ship was anchored. By noon of
this first day, however, it was plainly evident that Trimble
Rogers was done for. He uttered no complaints,
and withheld the groans behind his set teeth, but his
lank body was a-tremble with pain and fatigue. Whenever
he sank down to rest they had to raise him up and
set him on his legs again before he could totter a little
way farther.</p>

<p>"What say, Jack, to slingin' him on a pole, neck and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
heels?" suggested Bill Saxby. "Can we make him fast
with our belts?"</p>

<p>"And choke him to death? In Charles Town I saw
Captain Bonnet's pirates carry their wounded in litters
woven of boughs."</p>

<p>The suffering Trimble put a stop to this by shouting:</p>

<p>"Avast wi' the maunderin' nonsense! Push on, lads,
and leave this old hulk be. Many a goodly man have I
seen drop in the jungle. What matters it? Speed ye
to Cap'n Bonnet."</p>

<p>"Here is one pirate that won't desert a shipmate,"
declared Bill Saxby. "And how can we push on without
you, old True-Penny, to lay your nose to the trail?
I took no heed o' the marks and landfalls."</p>

<p>"Like a sailor ashore, mouth open and eyes shut,"
rasped the buccaneer of Hispaniola.</p>

<p>"Methinks I might find my way in this Carolina
country," ventured Jack Cockrell. "It would be easier
for a landsman like myself than for Bill who is city-bred
and a seaman besides."</p>

<p>"More wisdom from the stripling," said Trimble.
"Willing as I be to die sooner than delay ye and so vex
Stede Bonnet, it 'ud please me to live to overhaul that
sea chest of Blackbeard's."</p>

<p>"I'll stand by this condemned old relic," amiably
agreed Bill Saxby. "Do you request Cap'n Bonnet to
send a party to salvage us, Jack."</p>

<p>"He will take pleasure in it, Bill. Before I go let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
me help you find shelter,&mdash;dry limbs for props and a
thatch of palmetto leaves."</p>

<p>"Take no thought of us," urged Trimble. "Trust
me to set this lazy oaf to work. Now listen, Jack, and
carefully. Cap'n Bonnet's ship waits in the Cape Fear
River, twelve leagues to the north'ard of us. You will
find her betwixt a bay of the mainland and a big-sized
island where the river makes in from the sea. There will
be a lookout kept and I can tell ye where to meet a
boat."</p>

<p>With a memory as retentive as a printed page, the
keen-eyed old wanderer described the landscape league
by league, the streams and their direction, the hills which
were prominent, the broad stretches of savannah or
grassy meadow, the belts of pine forest, the tongues of
swamp which had to be avoided. Jack was compelled to
repeat the detailed instructions over and over, and he
was a far more studious pupil than when snuffy Parson
Throckmorton had rapped his knuckles and fired him
with rebellious dreams of piracy. At length, the buccaneer
was willing to acknowledge:</p>

<p>"Unless an Indian drive an arrow through the lad's
brisket, Bill, I can trust him to find our ship. Best give
him the musket."</p>

<p>"Me shoulder that carronade and trudge a dozen
leagues?" objected Jack. "I travel light and leave the
ordnance with you."</p>

<p>They insisted on his taking more than a third of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
food but he refused to deprive them of the water jug.
There would be streams enough to slake his thirst. It
was an affectionate parting. Bill Saxby's innocent blue
eyes were suffused and his chubby face sorrowful at the
thought that they might not meet again. Trimble Rogers
fished out his battered little Bible and quoted a few
verses, as appeared to be his habit on all solemn occasions.
Jack Cockrell knew him well enough by now to
find it not incongruous. Among this vanishing race of
sea fighters had been many a hero of the most fervent
piety. Their spirit was akin to that of Francis Drake
who summoned his crew to prayers before he cleared for
action.</p>

<p>And in this wise did Master Jack Cockrell set out
to bear a message from comrades in dire distress.
Moreover, in his hands were the lives of Joe Hawkridge
and those other marooned seamen, as he had every reason
to believe. It was a grave responsibility to be thrust
upon a raw lad in his teens who had been so carefully
nurtured by his fretful guardian of an uncle, Mr. Peter
Arbuthnot Forbes. Jack thought of this and said to
himself, with a smile:</p>

<p>"A few weeks gone, and I was locked in my room
without any dinner for loitering with Stede Bonnet's
pirates at the Charles Town tavern. My education has
been swift since then."</p>

<p>He was expectant of meeting no end of peril and
hardship and he fought down a sense of dread that was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
not to his discredit. But it was so decreed that he
should pass secure and unmolested. At first he went
too fast, without husbanding his strength, and loped
along like a hound whenever the country was clear of
brushwood. This wore him down and he failed to watch
carefully enough for his landmarks. Toward the end
of the day he became confused because he could not discern
the sea even by climbing a tree. But he tried to
keep bearing to the northeast until the sun went down.
Afraid of losing himself entirely and ignorant of the
lay of the land by night, he made his bivouac in a grove
of sycamore saplings and imagined Indians were creeping
up whenever the leaves rustled.</p>

<p>This fear of roaming savages troubled him next day
as he wearily trudged through this primeval wilderness
unknown to white settlers. It spurred him on despite
his foot-sore fatigue and he was making the journey
more rapidly than old Trimble Rogers, for all his cunning
woodcraft, had been able to accomplish it. Almost
at the end of his endurance, the plucky lad discerned
the sheen of a broad water in the twilight and so
came to the Cape Fear River.</p>

<p>He had worried greatly lest he might have veered too
far inland but there was the wooded bay and the fore-land
crowned with dead pines which had been swept by
forest fire. And out beyond it was the island, of the
size and shape described by Trimble Rogers, making a
harbor from the sea which rolled to the horizon rim.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>But no tall brig, nor any other vessel rode at anchor
in this silent and lonely haven. Jack had been told precisely
where to look for it. He had made no mistake.
Some emergency had caused Captain Stede Bonnet to
make sail and away.</p>

<p>A king's ship or some other hostile force might have
compelled him to slip his cable in haste, reflected Jack
as he descended to the shore of the bay. It was most
unlike the chivalrous Stede Bonnet to abandon two of
his faithful seamen without an effort to succor them.
Endeavoring to comfort himself with this surmise, the
sorely disappointed boy paced the sand far into the night
and gazed in vain for the glimmer of a fire or the spark
of a signal lantern in a ship's rigging. He could not
bear to think of the dark prospect should no help betide
him.</p>

<p>Some time before day he was between waking and
sleeping when a queer delusion distracted him. Humming
in his ears was the refrain of a song which was
both familiar and hauntingly pleasant. It seemed to
charm away his poignant anxieties, to lull him with a
feeling of safety. He wondered if his troublesome adventures
had made him light-headed. He moved not a
muscle but listened to this phantom music and noted that
it sounded louder and clearer instead of fading away.
And still he refused to believe that it was anything more
than a drowsy mockery.</p>

<p>At length a vagrant breeze brought him a snatch of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
this enjoyable chorus in deeper, stronger volume and he
leaped to his feet with a shout. It was no hallucination.
Lusty seamen were singing in time to the beat of their
oars, and Jack Cockrell knew it for the favorite song of
Stede Bonnet's crew. He could distinguish the words
as they rolled them out in buoyant, stentorian harmony:</p>

<div class='poem'>"An' when my precious leg was lopt,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Just for a bit of fun</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I picks it up, on t'other hopt,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' rammed it in a gun.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'What's that for?' cries out Ginger Dick,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">'What for? my jumpin' beau?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Why, to give the lubbers one more kick,'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><i>Yo, ho, with the rum below!</i>"</span><br />

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>A PRIVATE ACCOUNT TO SETTLE</h3>


<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE ship's boat was bound into the bay, probably
to lie there for daybreak, and Jack Cockrell
rushed down to the beach where he set up
such a frantic hullabaloo that the sailors ceased singing
and held their breath and their oars suspended. They
had come to look for Bill Saxby and Trimble Rogers,
but this was a strange voice. It was so odd a circumstance
that several of them hailed the shore with questions
loud and perplexed.</div>

<p>"Master John Cockrell, at your service," came back
the reply. "Captain Bonnet knows me. I am the lad
that clouted a six-foot pirate of yours for being saucy
to a maid in Charles Town."</p>

<p>This aroused a roar of laughter and there were gusty
shouts of:</p>

<p>"Here's that same Will Brant in the boat with us.
He shakes in his boots at the sound of ye."</p>

<p>"What's the game, lad? Have ye taken a ship of
your own to scour the Main?"</p>

<p>Jack ignored this good-natured badinage and, in dig<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>nified
accents, told them to come ashore and take him
off to the <i>Royal James</i>. In this company he had a reputation
to live up to as a man of parts and valor. They
let the boat ground on the smooth sand and one of them
lighted a torch of pitch-pine splinters. The fine young
gentleman who had strolled arm-in-arm with Stede Bonnet
to the tavern green was a ragged scarecrow and bedaubed
with red clay and black mud. This aroused
their sympathy before he told them of his escape from
the <i>Revenge</i> and his adventures with Bill Saxby and
the crippled buccaneer. In their turn they explained
how Captain Bonnet had sent them down the river to
await the return of the two men who were now stranded
in the wilderness two days' march distant.</p>

<p>"And why did your captain shift the brig from her
anchorage off the island?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>This amused the boat's crew who nudged each other
and were evasive until the master's mate who was in
charge went far enough to say:</p>

<p>"A sloop came in from the Pamlico River. Our ship
sought a snugger harbor, d'ye see? There was some
private business. We loaded the sloop with hogshead
of sugar, and bolts of damask, and silver ingots. His
Excellency, Governor Eden, of the North Carolina
Province, turns an honest penny now and then."</p>

<p>"The Governor of this Province is a partner in piracy?"
cried Jack.</p>

<p>"Brawl it not so loud, nor spill it to Cap'n Bonnet,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
cautioned the master's mate. "I confide this much to
stave off your foolish questions when ye board the ship."</p>

<p>There was no reason to tarry in the bay and the boat
pulled out to follow the course of the river and return
in haste to the brig <i>Royal James</i> in her more secluded
harbor. The news that Blackbeard was at his old rendezvous
within easy sail to the southward eclipsed all
other topics. And when it was learned that he had lost
the two sloops of his squadron, there was fierce delight.
Although the <i>Revenge</i> was a larger vessel and more
heavily manned and gunned, they were hilariously confident
of victory. It was a burning grudge and a private
quarrel, and fuel was added to the flame by the
tidings that a score or more of seamen had been mercilessly
marooned to perish because of their suspected
preference for Captain Stede Bonnet.</p>

<p>When Jack Cockrell caught sight of the shapely brig
as she loomed in the morning haze, it seemed as though
years had passed since he had enviously watched her
pass out over the Charles Town bar. Presently he spied
the soldierly captain on the quarter-deck, his spare
figure all taut and erect, his chin clean-shaven, his queue
powdered, his apparel fresh and in good taste. A ship
is like her master and the watch was sluicing down decks
or setting up the rigging which had slackened with the
heavy dew. Jack felt ashamed to let himself be seen.
This was no place for a ragamuffin.</p>

<p>Captain Bonnet strode to the gangway and stared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
down at this bit of human flotsam. He was quick to
recognize his boyish friend and admirer and ordered the
men to lower a boatswain's chair and lift Master Cockrell
aboard. Jack was, indeed, so stiffened and sore and
weary that he had been wondering how he could climb
the side of a ship.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, my son, bide your time," exclaimed Stede
Bonnet as they met on deck. "Tell it later. The master's
mate will enlighten me."</p>

<p>He led the way into the cabin which was in order and
simply furnished. One servant brewed fragrant coffee
from Arabia while another made a room ready for the
guest and fetched clean clothing from the captain's
chests and a tub of hot water. And as soon as the grateful
Master Cockrell had made himself presentable, he
was invited to sit down at table with the captain and
enjoy a meal of porridge and crisp English bacon and
fresh eggs from the ship's hen-coop in the long-boat and
hot crumpets and marmalade. And this after the
pinched ration of mouldy salt-horse and wormy hard-bread!
Captain Bonnet lighted a roll of tobacco leaves,
which he called a <i>cigarro</i>, and puffed clouds of smoke
while Master Cockrell cleaned every dish and lamented
that his skin felt too tight to begin all over again.</p>

<p>He was now in a mood to relate his strange yarn, from
its outset in the ill-fated merchant trader, <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>.
Eagerly he begged information concerning
her people after their shipwreck, but Captain Bonnet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
had been cruising far offshore to intercept a convoy of
rich West Indiamen from Jamaica for the old country.</p>

<p>"I will make it my duty to set you ashore at Charles
Town, Master Jack," said he, "and I pray you may
find your good uncle alive and still vowing to hang all
rogues of pirates."</p>

<p>"But I must sail with you, sir, till you have saved
Joe Hawkridge and his shipmates and blown Blackbeard
out of water."</p>

<p>"Rest easy on that," exclaimed Stede Bonnet.
"Those affairs are most urgent. My ship will drop
down the river to-day, with the turn o' the tide, and
heave to long enough to land a party, six men, to go in
search of Trimble Rogers who is the apple of my eye.
I shall not ask you to join them, but you can give directions
and pen a fair map, I trow."</p>

<p>"Gladly would I go," replied Jack, "but my poor
legs wobble like your valiant old buccaneer's. And my
feet are raw."</p>

<p>"You have proved yourself," was the fine compliment.
"I judged ye aright when we first met."</p>

<p>Soon the deck above them resounded to the tramp of
boots and the thump of sheet-blocks as the brisk seamen
made ready to cast the ship free. She was in competent
hands and so Stede Bonnet lingered below to enjoy
talking with the youth whose manners and breeding
were like his own. In a mood unusually confidential he
confirmed Jack's earlier impressions, that he was a pi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>rate
with a certain code of honor which reminded one
of Robin Hood of Sherwood Forest who robbed the
rich and befriended the poor. Touching on his mortal
quarrel with Blackbeard, he revealed how that traitorous
ruffian had proposed a partnership while he, Stede
Bonnet, was a novice at the trade. The plot all hatched
to take Bonnet's fine ship, the <i>Revenge</i>, from him,
Blackbeard had disclosed his hand at the final conference
when he said, with a sarcastic grimace:</p>

<p>"I see, my good sir, that you are not used to the cares
and duties of commanding a vessel, so I will relieve you
of 'em."</p>

<p>As soon as Captain Bonnet had mended his fortunes
and had the goodly brig <i>Royal James</i> to cruise in, his
ruling purpose was to regain the <i>Revenge</i> from Blackbeard
and at the same time wreak a proper punishment.</p>

<p>"So now if we can trap this black-hearted Teach before
he flits to sea," said Stede Bonnet, "you will see a
pretty engagement, Master Cockrell. But first we must
find the score o' men that he marooned. It will be a
deed of mercy, besides affording me a stronger crew."</p>

<p>The brig was soon standing down the river while the
landing party broke out an ample store of provisions
and powder and ball, with canvas for a tent. The plan
was for them to pitch a camp near the shore of the bay
to which they could fetch back Trimble Rogers and Bill
Saxby and there wait for their ship to return and take
them off. They were ready to go ashore when Captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Bonnet's navigator ordered the main-topsail laid aback
and the brig slowly swung into the wind. The delay
was brief and no sooner was the boat cast off than the
<i>Royal James</i> proceeded on the voyage to Cherokee
Inlet.</p>

<p>Clumsy as those sailing ships of two hundred years
ago appear to modern eyes, their lines were finely
moulded under water and with a favoring wind they
could log a fair distance in a day's run. It goes without
saying that this tall brig was shoved along for all
she was worth before a humming breeze that made her
creak, and during the night she was reckoned to be a
few miles to seaward of the sandy islands which extended
like a barrier outside of Cherokee Inlet. Jack
Cockrell stood a watch of his own, dead weary but with
no thought of sleep until he could hear the lookout shout
"Land ho!"</p>

<p>This cry came from aloft soon after dawn. The brig
moved toward the nearest of these exposed shoals while
her officers consulted a chart spread upon the cabin
roof. They were wary of running the ship aground
with Blackbeard no more than a few miles distant. So
bare were these yellow patches of sand that showed
against the green water that a group of men on any one
of them would have been easily discernible. The <i>Royal
James</i> coasted along outside of them under shortened
sail but discovered nothing to indicate a party of marooned
seamen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"But they must be out here somewhere," cried Jack
Cockrell, in great distress.</p>

<p>"They ought to be, for no trading vessel would take
'em off," replied the puzzled Captain Bonnet. "And
if they were towed out in boats as ye say, Jack, these
islands must ha' been where they were beached."</p>

<p>"But you won't give up the search, sir, without another
tack past those outermost shoals?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we shall rake them all, but Blackbeard may
have changed that crotchety mind of his and taken the
men back to his ship."</p>

<p>"I fear I have seen the last of my dear Joe Hawkridge,"
exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p>"From what you tell me, the young scamp is not so
easily disposed of," smiled Captain Bonnet. "I must
haul out to sea ere long. 'Tis poor business to let Blackbeard
glimpse my spars and so take warning."</p>

<p>This was sad news and Jack walked away to hide his
quivering lip. To examine the islands again was a forlorn
hope because already it seemed certain that nothing
alive moved on any of them. The brig passed them
closer than before as she made a long reach before turning
out to sea. It was the intention to sail in to engage
Blackbeard very early the next morning and meanwhile
he would be vigilantly blockaded.</p>

<p>Even Jack Cockrell, hopeful to the last, was compelled
to agree with the crew of the brig that not a solitary
man could be seen on these sea-girt cays and it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
seemed useless to send off a boat to explore them one
by one. There would have been some stir or signal,
even if men were too weak to stand. The air was
clear and from the brig's masts it was possible to sweep
every foot of sandy surface. Here was another
mystery of the sea. It occurred to Stede Bonnet to
ask:</p>

<p>"You took it for granted they were marooned, Jack,
when the boats passed from your sight and you were
hidden in the tree in the swamp. What if a quicker
death were dealt 'em?"</p>

<p>"That may be, sir."</p>

<p>The brig was leaving the coast astern. Jack moped
by himself until his curiosity was drawn to a group of
seamen upon the forecastle head who were talking loudly
and pointing at something in the water, well ahead of the
ship. One vowed it was a big sea-turtle asleep, another
was willing to wager his silver-mounted pistols that it
was a rum barrel, while a third announced that he'd
stake his head on its being a mermaid or her husband.
The after-deck brought a spy-glass to bear and perceived
that the thing was splashing about. The tiller
was shifted to bring it close aboard and soon Captain
Bonnet exclaimed that it was, indeed, a merman a-cruising
with a cask!</p>

<p>Jack Cockrell scampered to the heel of the bowsprit
to investigate this ocean prodigy. And as the cask
drifted nearer he saw that Joe Hawkridge was clinging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to it. There was no mistaking that dauntless grin and
the mop of carroty hair. A handy seaman tossed a bight
of line over his shoulders as he bobbed past the forefoot
of the brig and he was yanked bodily over the bulwark
like a strange species of fish. Flopping on deck
he waved a skinny arm in greeting and then Jack Cockrell
rushed at him, lifted him bodily, and dragged him
to the cabin.</p>

<p>"What ho, comrade!" said the dripping merman.
"Blast my eyes, but I was sick with worry for you. I
left you in that swamp&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I thought you dead, Joe. For the love o'
heaven, tell me how you fared and what&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Captain Bonnet interfered to say:</p>

<p>"I treated you more courteously than this, Jack.
Let us make him comfortable."</p>

<p>Accepting the rebuke, Jack bustled his amazing
friend into a change of clothes and saw that he was well
fed. Little the worse for his watery pilgrimage, Joe
Hawkridge explained at his leisure:</p>

<p>"Ned Rackham took the others away in the snow, as
I tell ye, Cap'n Bonnet, and there was I in the doleful
dumps. Prayers get answered and miracles do happen,
for next day there come a-floatin' to the beach a cask
full of grub and water. Good Peter Tobey, the carpenter's
mate, had a hand in launchin' it, no doubt, but
the Lord hisself steered the blessed cask. Well, while
I set a-giving thanks and thinkin' one thing an' another,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
I figgered that when I'd ate all the grub and swigged
the water, I was no further along."</p>

<p>"And so you thought you would trust the Lord
again," suggested Captain Bonnet.</p>

<p>"Aye, sir, that was it. By watchin' the tides I reckoned
I might drift to another island and so work to the
coast, taking my provisions with me. There was some
small line in the cask that Peter Tobey had wrapped
the stores in, and I knotted a harness about the cask
that I could slip an arm in, and off I goes when the tide
sets right. But some kind of a dratted cross-current
ketched me and I'm sailin' out to sea, I finds, without
compass or cross-staff. Bound to get to London River,
eh, Jack, same as we started out on the silly little raft."</p>

<p>"Whew, this adventure was bad enough," cried Jack,
"but when you saw Ned Rackham's pirates in the boat,
and you couldn't run away,&mdash;I wonder, honest, Joe, you
didn't die of fright."</p>

<p>"What for? This is no trade for a nervous wight.
And now for a bloody frolic with Blackbeard's bullies."</p>

<p>"There is a share of his treasure for you, Joe, as soon
as we can go find it," gleefully announced Master Cockrell.
"I have the chart drawn all true with mine own
hand. Let me get it."</p>

<p>While the two lads pored entranced over the map of
the branching creek and the pine-covered knoll, the crew
of the <i>Royal James</i> were overhauling weapons and
clearing the ship for action. It disappointed them to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
lack the twenty men whom they had expected to find
marooned but this made them no less eager for battle.
Concerning Ned Rackham, there was no feud with him
or grudge to square and he could go his way in the little
trading snow without fear of molestation from Stede
Bonnet.</p>

<p>Under cover of night the <i>Royal James</i> worked back to
the sandy islands and anchored in the channel. One of
her boats had ventured within sight of the Inlet for a
stealthy reconnaissance and reported that the <i>Revenge</i>
was still in the harbor. Captain Bonnet was considering
his plan of attack. He said nothing about it to Jack
Cockrell and his chum, the merman, and they greedily
listened to the gossip of the petty officers or thrashed out
theories of their own.</p>

<p>To sail boldly into the harbor was a ticklish risk to
run as there was no pilot aboard who knew the inner
channel and the depths of water. All the gunners were
in favor of attempting it because they yearned to settle
it with crashing broadsides. But the battered, hairy sea-dogs
who had fought it out in hand-to-hand conflicts on
the Caribbean were for leaving the brig in safe water and
sending fifty men in boats to board the <i>Revenge</i> at the
first break of day.</p>

<p>In the midst of the fo'castle argument, Captain Bonnet
sent for Jack Cockrell and told him:</p>

<p>"You are to keep out of harm's way, my young gamecock.
I have undertaken to deliver you to your es<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>teemed
uncle with arms and legs intact, and your head
on your shoulders."</p>

<p>"But I am lusty enough to poke about with a pike
or serve at a gun tackle," protested the unhappy Master
Cockrell.</p>

<p>"I expect you to obey me," was the stern mandate.
"You will have company. This Joe Hawkridge is to
stay with you."</p>

<p>"But he is a rare hand in a fight, Captain Bonnet.
You should have seen him in the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>."</p>

<p>"The boy is weak and all unstrung, though he carries
it bravely, Jack. And Blackbeard's men would take
special pains to kill him as a deserter."</p>

<p>By this humane verdict the two lads were shielded
from peril, as far as it lay within Stede Bonnet's power.
They should have felt grateful to him but on the contrary
it made them quite peevish and they sulked by
themselves up in the bow of the ship until it was time
to eat again. Then their gnawing appetites persuaded
them to forgive their considerate host.</p>

<p>The pirates moved about the deck until far into the
night while the sparks flew from cutlass blades pressed
to the whirling grindstone. Tubs were filled with hand-grenades
and fire-pots, the deck strewn with sand, the
magazine opened and powder passed up. Stede Bonnet
was careful to see for himself that all things were in
order. At such times he was a martinet of a soldier.</p>

<p>Anxiously he watched the weather signs, as did every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
seasoned sailor on board. It bade fair to be a bright
morning with an easterly air and this would carry the
brig into the harbor with the minimum danger of stranding
if the lead were cast often enough. Joe Hawkridge
and Jack Cockrell were of some assistance in explaining
the marks and bearings of the channel, and Captain
Bonnet consulted them over the chart unrolled upon
the cabin table. He had made up his mind to sail the
brig in and risk the hazards of shoal water. When he
went on deck, Jack thought of a topic as thrilling as
this imminent duel between ships and he remarked with
joyous excitement:</p>

<p>"Now, Joe, as soon as ever Blackbeard gets his drubbing,
we beg a boat and men and gear of Captain Bonnet
and go up the creek to fish out the treasure chest
and dig in the knoll."</p>

<p>"Hook your fish before you fry 'em," replied the
sagacious apprentice-boy. "This scrummage with the
<i>Revenge</i> will be no dancin' heel-and-toe. A bigger ship,
more guns and men, and a Blackbeard who will fight
like a demon when he's cornered. Crazy though he may
be, he is the most dangerous pirate afloat."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>OUR HEROES SEEK SECLUSION</h3>


<div class='unindent'><big>A</big>N hour before dawn the anchor was aweigh and
the <i>Royal James</i> drifted ahead like a shadow, in
between the outer islands where the fairway was
wide and safe. Her gun-ports were open and every
man was alertly at his station. It was a silent ship excepting
when an officer passed an order along. Joe
Hawkridge began to feel more sanguine of winning
against odds. He had never seen such iron discipline as
this in the bedlam aboard the <i>Revenge</i>. Stede Bonnet
knew how to slacken the reins and when to apply the
curb. His men were loyal because he dealt out justice
as well as severity.</div>

<p>"The captain says we must go below when the action
commences, Joe," dismally observed Jack Cockrell.</p>

<p>"It goes against the grain but we will not dispute
him," was the sage reply. "We needn't be idle. You
can lend a hand with the powder or pass the water
buckets to douse the fire if she gets ablaze. And there's
the wounded to carry into the cockpit and the blood to
mop up, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough o' that," cried Jack, getting pale about the
gills. "You take it like a butcher!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"What else is it, you big moon-calf? Set me safe
ashore in that Charles Town of yours, and I hope ne'er
to see another weapon barring a spoon and a knife to
cut my vittles."</p>

<p>"There is sense in that," agreed young Master Cockrell.</p>

<p>Smartly handled, the brig crept in as far as she dared
go without more light by which to avoid the shallower
water. The anchor was dropped to a short cable and
buoyed ready to slip. It was estimated that the distance
from Blackbeard's ship was somewhat more than
a mile. The stars faded and the cloudless sky began to
take on a roseate hue. The light breeze which had
breathed like a cool zephyr through the night was dying
in languid catspaws. Gradually the dark outline of
coastal swamp and forest was uncurtained. And eager
eyes were able to discern the yellow spars and blurred
hull of the <i>Revenge</i> against the gloomy background.</p>

<p>Stede Bonnet's brig was, of course, pricked out much
more sharply with the seaward horizon behind her. To
her crew, in this hushed morning, there came a prolonged,
shrill note that was like the call of a bird. It
trilled with a silvery sweetness and was repeated over
and over again.</p>

<p>"A bos'n's pipe," said Captain Bonnet, a hand cupped
at his ear. "Blackbeard has sighted us and is mustering
his crew."</p>

<p>So faint was the breeze that the command was given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
to man two boats and take a hawser from the brig to tow
her through the inner channel. Before they were in
motion, however, the pearly mist began to roll out of the
Cherokee swamp as if a great cauldron were steaming.
The weather favored it, heat in the air and little wind.
The mist seemed also to rise from the water, hanging
low but as thick as a summer fog. It shrouded the coast
and Blackbeard's ship and crept out across the harbor
until the brig was enveloped in it.</p>

<p>"'Twas like this when we swum ashore and found the
pirogue, Cap'n Bonnet," said Joe Hawkridge. "A curious
kind o' white smother from the swamp."</p>

<p>"And how long did it hang thus?" was the impatient
query.</p>

<p>"When the sun was well up, sir, it seemed to burn
away like. It has the same look as the fever-breedin'
vapors of Darien and Yucatan."</p>

<p>Captain Bonnet called his boats back and was in an
ugly humor. There was no towing the brig through
this bothersome fog which obscured every mark and left
a man bewildered. And instead of surprising Blackbeard
unprepared, he would now have time to make his
ship ready. However, Stede Bonnet was not a man to
wring his hands because a well-laid scheme went wrong.
Without delay the crew was assembled in the waist and
he spoke to them from the break of the poop.</p>

<p>"We shall make this weather serve our purpose, lads.
Fill the boats, every man to his billet. The mates will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
see to it that the oars are well muffled. Silence above all
things. Nimbly now."</p>

<p>There was no need to say more. They fathomed the
strategy which would enable them to approach Blackbeard's
ship unheard and unseen and then swarm over
her side in a ferocious onslaught. Cheerily they took
stock of their weapons, drank a health from a tub of stiff
grog, and lined up for Captain Bonnet's inspection.
They wore clean clothes, the best they could find in
their bags, as has always been the sailor's habit when
going into action. The ship was left in charge of
the navigator with a few men who were the least stalwart
or experienced in such desperate adventures as
this.</p>

<p>Stede Bonnet went in command of the largest boat to
lead the party and single out Blackbeard as his own particular
foe. There was a large chance that he might not
return and he therefore left instructions for the disposal
of the brig, advising the navigator to take her to Charles
Town and there sue for the king's pardon in behalf of
those on board. He shook hands with Jack Cockrell
and Joe Hawkridge, bade them be careful of their own
safety, and with no more ado took his place in the boat.
The flotilla stole away from the brig, sunburned, savage
men with bright weapons for whom life was like a throw
of the dice, and the pearly fog concealed them when they
had passed no more than a cable-length away. So skilfully
was the sound of the oars deadened that you would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
not have guessed that boats were moving across the
harbor.</p>

<p>"Blackbeard fights like a tiger but trust Cap'n Bonnet
to outwit him," said Joe Hawkridge, who stood at
the brig's rail with Jack at his elbow.</p>

<p>"It will be mighty hard waiting," was the tense reply.
"We shall know when they find the <i>Revenge</i>. They
are not apt to miss her, with a compass in the captain's
boat."</p>

<p>"Aye, there'll be noise enough. Plaguey queer, eh,
Jack, to be a-loafin' with nothing to see, like your head
was wrapped in a blanket. They ought to fetch alongside
Blackbeard in a half-hour. Go turn the sand-glass
in the cabin."</p>

<p>They fidgeted about in aimless fashion and fell into
talk with the navigator, or artist, as he was called, a
middle-aged man who had been a master mariner in the
slave trade. He told them a yarn or two of the Guinea
coast but he, too, was restless and left them to stump up
and down the deck and peer toward the shore. Jack
dodged into the cabin to watch the sand trickle into the
bottom of the glass. Never was a half-hour so long in
passing.</p>

<p>A yell from Joe Hawkridge recalled him to the deck.
He listened but heard no distant pistol shots or the
hoarse uproar of men in mortal combat. Joe raised a
warning hand and told him to stand still. There came
a faint splash. It might have been a fish leaping but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Joe insisted that it was made by a careless oar. Jack
heard it again and then fancied he caught the softened
beat of muffled oars close at hand.</p>

<p>"They lost the course. The fog confused 'em," said
he, in great disgust.</p>

<p>"But why come back to the ship?" demanded Joe.
"They could lay and wait for the fog to lift a little.
And I told Cap'n Bonnet to bear to the north'ard if in
doubt and find the shore of the swamp. Then he could
coast back to the beach and so strike the <i>Revenge</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, here they come, Joe, and there is sure to be a
good reason. Mayhap the fog cleared to landward and
they intend to tow the brig in, after all."</p>

<p>Just then the foremost boat became visible and behind
it was the vague shape of another. The puzzled lads
stared and stared and the hair stiffened on their scalps
for sheer horror. These were not the boats from the
<i>Royal James</i>. They were filled with Blackbeard's own
pirates from the <i>Revenge</i>!</p>

<p>The explanation was simple enough. Joe Hawkridge
read it at a glance. Blackbeard was not the
drunken chuckle-head that Stede Bonnet had assumed
him to be. He, too, had taken advantage of the fog to
attempt to carry the enemy by stealth. The wit of the
one had been matched by the other. And the two flotillas
had gone wide enough in passing to escape mutual
discovery. In a way it was a pirates' comedy but there
were two spectators who foresaw a personal tragedy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
They fled for the cabin and scuttled through a small
door in a bulkhead which admitted them to the dark hold
of the ship.</p>

<p>It was their purpose to hide in the remotest nook that
could be found. Falling over odds and ends of cargo
they burrowed like rats and stowed themselves behind a
tier of mahogany logs which had been taken out of some
prize or other. They were in the bottom of the ship,
upon the rough floor covering the stone ballast. Then
these frightened stowaways found respite to confer in
tremulous whispers.</p>

<p>"This is the very dreadfulest fix of all, Joe. I had a
fair look at Blackbeard himself, in the stern of the boat,&mdash;red
ribbons in his whiskers, and his sash stuck full of
pistols."</p>

<p>"That old rip isn't an easy man to mistake, Jack.
Now the fat <i>is</i> in the fire," replied the Hawkridge lad
who, for once, appeared discouraged. "Cap'n Bonnet
is a vast sight happier than us. He gets the <i>Revenge</i>
without strikin' a blow."</p>

<p>"But Blackbeard gets <i>us</i>," wailed Master Cockrell.
"And I helped to chase him through the swamp after we
rammed the pirogue into his wherry and capsized the
treasure chest. Do you suppose he knew me just now?"</p>

<p>"Those little red eyes of his are passing keen. But
didn't ye tell me of smearing your face with mud that
day to fend off the mosquitoes? It may ha' disguised
you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"A little comfort in that, Joe, but to be found in
Stede Bonnet's brig bodes ill enough. Of a truth we be
born to trouble as the sparks fly upward ever since we
joined the pirates. What is your advice?"</p>

<p>"To stay hid below and pray God for another shift
o' fortune," piously answered Joe. "There is no fear
of Blackbeard's rummagin' the hold at present. He
must decide if he'll fight the <i>Revenge</i> or give her the
slip. And whilst him and his men are busied on deck, I
can make bold to search for stores fit to eat. Cap'n
Bonnet allus had a well-found ship. Blast it, Jack, my
hearty, stock us up and we could lie tucked in the forepeak
for a month o' Sundays."</p>

<p>"But the rats and the darkness and the stinks, and to
be expecting discovery," was Jack's dreary comment.</p>

<p>"It would ha' looked like a parlor to me when I was
on that barren cay and sighted Ned Rackham's rogues
coming off from the snow," said the other stowaway.
He was beginning to recuperate from the shock.</p>

<p>They were in a mood for no more speech but sat in
this rayless cavern of a hold and strove to hear any
sounds which might indicate the course of events on
deck. There was no hubbub of firearms nor the cries of
wounded men. It was foolish to assume that the dozen
seamen who had been left to keep the ship would attempt
resisting Blackbeard's mob of pirates all primed
for slaughter. When quietude seemed to reign all
through the ship Joe Hawkridge whispered this opinion:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"If his fancy was to deal with 'em later, he would
pitch the lot down here in the hold. Failing that, Jack,
he has offered 'em the chance to enlist. Being so few,
they can't plot mischief, and he has lost the hands he left
aboard the <i>Revenge</i>."</p>

<p>"But I thought all this crew was true as steel to Stede
Bonnet, Joe."</p>

<p>"Many a man'll change his mind to save his life," was
the reply. "And these lads aren't what you call Cap'n
Bonnet's picked men. As for the navigator, Blackbeard
needs him to fill Ned Rackham's berth."</p>

<p>Soon Joe Hawkridge told Jack to stay where he was.
Now was the time to explore the lower part of the ship.
Squeezing his comrade's hand in farewell, Joe crawled
aft to make his way to a rough bulkhead which walled
off a storeroom built next to the cabin. The boys had
passed through it in their headlong flight below. Here
was kept the bulk of the ship's provisions. Joe Hawkridge
had learned of the storeroom through helping the
steward hoist out a barrel of pork.</p>

<p>With his heart in his throat the venturesome lad
groped like a blind man, grievously barking his shins
and his knuckles, until he bumped into the timbers of the
bulkhead. Inching himself along, he came to the small
door which had been cut into the hold to connect with
the main hatch. He had slipped the iron bar behind
him during his flight with Jack Cockrell. Pulling the
door ajar he wormed through into the storeroom which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
was also dark as midnight. His fingers touched what
seemed to be a tierce of beef but he had no tools to start
the head or the hoops. In the same manner he discovered
other casks and barrels but they were utterly useless
to him. Here was food enough, he reflected, if a
man had teeth to gnaw through oak staves.</p>

<p>Now and again he had to cross to the other door which
led into the cabin passageway and press his ear against
a plank to make certain against surprise. Up and down
the dark room he blundered, refusing to admit himself
beaten. The first bit of cheer was when his foot struck
a round object as solid as a round shot and he picked up
a small Dutch cheese. This renewed his courage and he
ransacked the corners on hands and knees. Blackbeard's
treasure chest was not half so precious as a side of salted
fish which he ran down by scent, saying to himself:</p>

<p>"With this rancid cheese and the slab o' ancient cod,
ye could smell my course a league to wind'ard."</p>

<p>In a crumpled sack he found a few pounds of what
seemed to be wheat flour, by the feel and taste of it.
Poor stuff as it was, dry and uncooked, he added it to
his stock.</p>

<p>"Rubbishy vittles," he sighed. "They may keep a
man alive but he'll choke to death a-swallowin' of 'em."</p>

<p>Water was the desperate necessity and it was not to
be sought for in the storeroom. There was rum enough,
the place reeked with it, but to thirsty throats it was so
much liquid fire. Joe was resolved not to return to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Jack Cockrell without a few pints of water if reckless
enterprise could procure it. Was the cabin still empty?
He stood for a long time and listened but there was not
a sound beyond the door of the passageway. Taking
his courage in both hands he pushed at the door and it
creaked open on rusty hinges. Light as a feather he
moved one foot in front of the other, halted, advanced
another step, and so entered the large cabin in which
Stede Bonnet had lived with a Spartan simplicity.</p>

<p>What Joe coveted was the porous jar or water-monkey
which hung suspended in a netting above the
table. It was kept filled, he knew, in order to cool the
tepid water from the casks. A heavenly sight it was to
him to see the drops sweating on its rounded sides. He
snatched it down and was about to make a swift retirement,
but still spread upon the table he noted the chart
of the Carolina and Virginia coasts which he had pored
over with Stede Bonnet. This he delayed to roll up and
tuck under one arm, not that he expected to employ it
himself, but to make cruising more difficult for Blackbeard.</p>

<p>This bit of strategy held him a moment too long. He
shot a glance over his shoulder, alarmed by a tread on
the companion ladder. Horrified he beheld a pair of
Spanish boots with scarlet, crinkled morocco tops, and
they encased bandy legs which were strong and thick.
What saved the miserable young Hawkridge was that
the occupant of these splendid boots paused half-way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
down the ladder to shout a profane command or two in
those husky accents so feared by all lawful shipmen.</p>

<p>Before that sable beard came into his field of vision
the lad was in full stride, running like a whippet, chart
under one arm, water-jar under the other. He checked
himself to ease the door behind him just as the truculent
captor of the <i>Royal James</i> brig reached the foot of the
ladder and let his gaze rove about the cabin. Sinking
to the floor of the storeroom, Joe was afraid that for
once he was about to swoon like a silly maid at sight of
a mouse. As he had truly said, this pirating was no
trade for a nervous man. Never mind, a miss was as
good as a mile. Thankful for the darkness that closed
around him, he slung the water-monkey over his shoulder
in its hammock of netted cord, pushed the side of
codfish inside his shirt, poked the chart into his boot-leg,
put the cheese in the sack atop the flour, and was
freighted for his journey through the hold.</p>

<p>This he accomplished after great difficulty and had to
whistle and wait for a response before he could be sure
of Jack Cockrell's whereabouts.</p>

<p>"What luck, Joe?" was the plaintive question. "I'd
sooner starve than be left alone in this dungeon."</p>

<p>"Behold the dashing 'prentice-boy with another hairbreadth
escape to his credit," replied the hero. "Be
thankful for your dinner 'cause Blackbeard all but made
a mouthful of me."</p>

<p>"You saw him, Joe?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Up to the middle of him, and that was a-plenty.
Don't ask me. I had a bad turn."</p>

<p>"I feel sick, too," said Jack. "The smell of this vile
bilge-water breeds a nausea, and, whew, 'tis worse than
ever."</p>

<p>"Bilge, my eye! You sniff the banquet I fetched ye.
Here's a prime cheese that was hatched when Trimble
Rogers was a pup."</p>

<p>Jack offered a feeble apology and felt revived after a
pull at the water-monkey. What they craved most was
a spark of light, the glimmer of a candle to lift this appalling
gloom which pressed down like a visible burden.
With nothing to do but discuss the situation from every
slant and angle of conjecture, it was Joe Hawkridge's
theory that Stede Bonnet would not rest content with
regaining the <i>Revenge</i> but would come out to attack the
brig as soon as the wind favored. His hatred of Blackbeard
was one motive but there was a point of honor
even more compelling.</p>

<p>"He called you his guest, Jack," explained Joe, "and
I never did see a man so jealous of his plighted word
when once he swore it. He took obligation to set you
safe in Charles Town, d'ye see? And powder smoke
won't stop him."</p>

<p>"Will Blackbeard tarry for a fight, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Not to my notion. He knows well this brig is no
match for the <i>Revenge</i>, knows it better than did Cap'n
Bonnet, what with all the heavy metal slung aboard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
from the sloop. And what does Blackbeard gain by
having this brig hammered into a cocked hat? Fate
tricked him comically with this swappin' about of ships."</p>

<p>"And will he linger on this coast? Oh, Joe, if he
goes for a long cruise, what in mercy's name becomes of
us two?"</p>

<p>"A long cruise, it looks like, shipmate. In the <i>Revenge</i>
he could laugh at the small king's men-o'-war
commissioned to hunt him down. He was ready to slap
alongside any of 'em. Now 'tis different. As another
flea in his ear, I stole the only chart of these waters.
To the south'ard he'll turn, and I will bet that rampageous
cheese on it."</p>

<p>"Clear to the Bay of Honduras?" said Jack.</p>

<p>"As far as that, at a guess. Or he may skirt the
Floridas to look for Spanish prizes and put in at the
Dry Tortugas which is a famous rendezvous for pirates
of the Main. He will be hot to fit himself with a bigger
ship, by capture or by some knavish trick such as he
dealt Cap'n Bonnet."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>BLACKBEARD APPEARS IN FIRE AND BRIMSTONE</h3>


<div class='unindent'><big>H</big>ERE was a tragic predicament from which
there was no release. Jack Cockrell was firmly
convinced that Blackbeard must have recognized
him that day in the swamp while Joe felt no less
certain that he was marked for death because he had
been one of the party of marooned mutineers. The
hope of prolonging their existence by means of raiding
the storeroom had ebbed after Joe's investigation. Such
provisions as had been broken out of bulk were kept in
lockers and pantries on deck where they were convenient
to the galley and forecastle. It was realized also that
their twittering nerves could not long withstand the
darkness and suspense once the brig had put out to sea.
Joe Hawkridge had nothing more to say about enduring
it a month o' Sundays.</div>

<p>While the brig remained at anchor they clung to the
thought that Captain Stede Bonnet might intervene in
their behalf. It did bring them a gleam of solace to
imagine him hoisting sail on the <i>Revenge</i> and crowding
out to rake the brig with his formidable broadsides.
And yet they were in doubt whether the <i>Revenge</i> was
fit to proceed at once, what with all the work there had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
been to do, rigging a new foremast, caulking leaky
seams, repairing the other ravages of the storm.</p>

<p>These pitiable stowaways had no means of telling one
hour from another until, at length, they heard over their
heads the faint, musical strokes of the ship's bell on the
forecastle head. This led them to believe that the fog
had cleared else Blackbeard would not have revealed the
vessel's position. And lifting fog meant a breeze to
sweep it away from the harbor.</p>

<p>"Eight bells she strikes, the first o' the forenoon
watch," said Joe. "We have been cooped in this black
pit a matter of three hours a'ready."</p>

<p>"No more than that?" groaned Jack. "It seems at
least a week. We must divert ourselves in some wise.
What say if I learn you a bit o' Latin? And you can
say over such sea songs as come to mind, for me to tuck
in my memory."</p>

<p>"Well said, my worthy scholar. 'Tis high time we
bowled ahead with my eddication as a proper gentleman."</p>

<p>Jack began to conjugate <i>amo</i>, <i>amas</i>, <i>amat</i>, and the
pupil droned it after him but the verb <i>to love</i> recalled a
black-eyed lass who had stolen his heart in the Azores
and he veered from the Latin lesson to confide that sentimental
passage. So Jack hammered nouns of the first
declension into him until they grew tired of that, and
then the sea waif played his part by reciting such fo'castle
ballads as "<i>Neptune's Raging Fury</i>; <i>or The Gallant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Seaman's Sufferings</i>," and "<i>Sir Walter Raleigh Sailing
in the Lowlands</i>."</p>

<p>This was better than the slow agony of waiting in silence,
but Joe spoiled it by turning lovelorn and Jack
bemourned fair Dorothy Stuart of Charles Town whom
he would never greet again, and they sang very softly
together a verse of "<i>The Maid's Lamentation</i>" which
went like this:</p>

<div class='poem'>"There shall be no Scarf go on my Head,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">No Comb into my Hair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">No Fire burn, no Candle light</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To shew my Beauty fair,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For never will I married be</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Until the Day I die,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Since the Seas and the Winds</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Has parted my Love and me."</span><br />
</div>

<p>This left them really in worse spirits than before, and
they drowsed off to sleep, and no wonder, after such a
night as they had passed. Accustomed to broken
watches, Joe Hawkridge slept uneasily with one ear
open. Once or twice he sat up, heard Jack's steady
snores, and lay down again. It was the ship's bell which
finally brought him to, and he counted the strokes.</p>

<p>"Five bells, but what watch is it?" he muttered anxiously.
"How long was I napping? Lost track o'
the time, so I have, and can't say if it's night or day."</p>

<p>He sat blinking into the darkness and then had an in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>spiration.
So staunch and well-kept was the brig that
the deck seams were tight and no light filtered through.
Joe left his hiding-place and groped along to where he
thought the main hatch ought to be. Gazing upward he
saw a gleam like a silvered line between the coaming and
the edge of the canvas cover which was battened with
iron bars. This persuaded him that the day had not yet
faded, and he concluded that he had heard the bell strike
either in the afternoon watch or the second dog watch of
early evening.</p>

<p>This he imparted to Jack, after prodding him awake.
They mulled it over and agreed that Captain Bonnet
must have found the <i>Revenge</i> unready to weigh anchor
or he would have engaged the brig ere this. Perhaps
there was not breeze enough for either vessel to move.
Another hour of this stressful tedium and they heard a
sound of sharp significance. It was the lap-lap of
water against the vessel's side. No more than the thickness
of the planking was between them and this tinkling
sea, and Joe exclaimed, in an agitated whisper:</p>

<p>"A breeze o' wind! Gentle it draws, but steady, like
it comes off the land at sundown."</p>

<p>"The same as it did when we were blown offshore on
the little raft, after we quitted the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>,"
replied Jack.</p>

<p>"Blackbeard will take advantage of it to make for
the open sea. There be three things offered us, Master
Cockrell, to starve or go mad in this blighted hold, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
sally on deck and beg mercy, which means a short shift,
or to climb out softly in the night and try to swim
for it."</p>

<p>"Swim to what, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Swim to the bottom, most likely. But we might
fetch one o' them cays or the coast itself if he steers close
in to find smooth water. 'Tis the worst odds yet but
I'd sooner drown than tarry in this vessel. One miracle
was wrought when the cask came driftin' to the beach to
save me, and who knows but the Lord can spare another
one for the salvation of us poor lads that mean to do
right and forsake piratin'."</p>

<p>As they expected, there came soon the familiar racket
of making sail and trimming yards and the clank of the
capstan pawls. Then the anchor flukes scraped and
banged against the bow timbers. The vessel heeled a
little and the lapping water changed its tune to a swash-swash
as the hull pushed it aside. The brig was alive
and in motion.</p>

<p>"She makes no more than two or three knots," observed
Joe, after a little while. "Ye can tell by the
feel of her. The wind is steady but small."</p>

<p>"Then he can't go clear of the islands till long after
night," thankfully returned Jack.</p>

<p>Joe made another trip to crane his neck at the main
hatch. The bright thread of daylight had dimmed. He
could scarce discern it. The lads occupied themselves
with reckoning the distance, the hour, and the vessel's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
speed. Now that Joe had satisfied himself that the end
of the day was near, he knew what the ship's bell meant
when it was struck every half-hour. They would await
the passing of another hour, until two bells of the first
watch, by which time they calculated the brig should be
in the wide, outer channel between the seaward islands.</p>

<p>The plan was to emerge through the forepeak in the
very bows of the ship where a scuttle was let into the
deck. There they might hope to lower themselves to
the chain stays under the bowsprit and so drop into the
sea. They would be washed past the ship, close to her
side, and into the wake, and there was little chance
of drawing attention. True it was that in this hard
choice they preferred to swim to the bottom if so it had
to be.</p>

<p>They crouched where they were hid, waiting to hear
the fateful signal of two bells. It struck, mellow, clear,
and they were about to creep in the direction of the forepeak.
But Joe Hawkridge gripped his comrade's arm
and held him fast. A whispered warning and they
ceased to move. Behind them, in the after part of the
ship, gleamed a lantern. It illumined the open door of
the bulkhead which walled off the storeroom. And in
this doorway, like a life-sized portrait, grotesque and
sinister, set in a frame, was the figure of Blackbeard.</p>

<p>He advanced into the hold and the cowering stowaways
assumed that he had come to search them out.
The impulse was to dash into the forepeak and so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
plunge overboard, flinging away all caution, but before
their palsied muscles could respond, the behavior of
Blackbeard held them irresolute and curious. He had
turned his back to them and was shouting boisterously to
others to follow him. Seven men came through the
doorway, one after the other, hanging back with evident
reluctance. It was impossible to discern who they were,
whether officers or seamen. Every one carried in his
arms what looked to be a tub or an iron pot. These
they set upon the dunnage boards which covered the ballast
and made a flooring in the hold.</p>

<p>Blackbeard bellowed at them to squat in a circle, which
they meekly did. He was in one of his fiendishly mirthful
humors, rumpling his beard, strutting to and fro,
laughing in senseless outbursts. At such times his men
were most fearful for their lives. What sort of an infernal
pastime he had now concocted was beyond the
imagination of the lads who were concealed a dozen
yards away. He was not hunting them, this much was
plain, and it seemed wise to be quiet and avoid drawing
attention to themselves.</p>

<p>They saw Blackbeard ignite a torch at the lantern
and poke it into one pot after another. Flames began
to burn, blue and green and yellow, and lurid smoke
rolled to the deck-beams overhead. Amid this glare
and reek of combustibles, Blackbeard waved his torch
and tremendously proclaimed:</p>

<p>"Come, lads, we be all devils together, with a hell of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
our own,&mdash;brimstone fires and pitch. Now, braggarts,
see how long ye can bear it. 'Tis a foretaste of what's
in store for all hands. At this game I'll outlast ye, for,
harkee, I sold my soul to the Old Scratch as is well
known."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 407px;">
<img src="images/illus7.jpg" width="407" height="500" alt="HE LOOMED LIKE THE BELIAL WHOM HE WAS SO FOND OF CLAIMING AS HIS MENTOR" title="HE LOOMED LIKE THE BELIAL WHOM HE WAS SO FOND OF CLAIMING AS HIS MENTOR" />
<span class="caption">HE LOOMED LIKE THE BELIAL WHOM HE WAS SO FOND OF CLAIMING AS HIS MENTOR</span>
</div>

<p>He stirred his infernal pots and the greasy smoke
rolled upward in choking volume. The brimstone
fumes were so vile and noxious that the victims of
this outlandish revel soon gasped and wheezed. But
they dared not object nor move from their places among
the villainous pots. Blackbeard enjoyed their sufferings,
taunting them as milksops and poltroons who
could not endure even this taste of Gehenna. He himself
appeared to be unaffected by it, lurching from one
man to another, whacking them with the burning torch
or playfully upsetting them. In the gaseous pall of
smoke he loomed like the Belial whom he was so fond of
claiming as his mentor.</p>

<p>Finally one of his involuntary guests toppled over in
a faint. Blackbeard was kind enough to haul him to the
door and boot him through it. A second man dragged
himself thither. A third found voice to supplicate. The
witch-fires still smoked and stewed in the pots and
Blackbeard had proved that he was the toughest demon
of them all.</p>

<p>The two stowaways watched this demented exploit in
sheer wonderment. The fumes were not dense in
their part of the hold and they could breathe, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
they well-nigh strangled in trying to refrain from
coughing. The fires of tar and brimstone and what not
cast so much light that they dared not betray themselves
by crawling toward the forepeak. The upright beams
between the keelson and the deck threw black shadows
over them and they were in no great peril of detection so
long as they stayed motionless.</p>

<p>Joe Hawkridge had heard gossip of this extraordinary
amusement as a kind of initiation for hands newly
joining Blackbeard's ship. He therefore read it that
these unfortunates were some of Stede Bonnet's men
who had been captured with the brig. They had been
allowed to enlist and were being taught to respect their
new master.</p>

<p>Jack Cockrell had hugely admired young Joe for his
ready wit and coolness in other crises of their mutual
fortunes but now came a moment in which the astute sea
urchin surpassed himself. It was not too much to say
that he displayed absolute genius with the sturdy Master
Cockrell to aid and abet him. Joe clawed in the dark
until he found the sack with a few pounds of wheat flour
in it. A quick whisper and his comrade grasped the
great idea. They took no thought of a sequel. They
would trust to opportunity. Hastily they rubbed the
flour into their shirts and breeches. They covered their
faces with it and lavishly sprinkled their hair. They
looked at each other in the shadow of the beams and
were pleased with their handiwork.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Another whispered consultation and Joe possessed
himself of the cannon-ball of a cheese while Jack
grasped the side of salt-fish by the tail. They resembled
two whitened clowns of a pantomime but in spirit
they were as grimly serious as the menace of death could
make them.</p>

<p>Blackbeard was dancing clumsily, like a drunken
bear, and deriding with lewd oaths the two or three tortured
survivors of his brimstone carnival. In a high,
wailing voice which rose to a shriek there was borne to
him the words:</p>

<p>"Ye dirked poor Jesse Strawn and left him rotting
in the swamp. I was a true and faithful seaman, Cap'n
Teach."</p>

<p>A deeper voice boomed out, filling the hold with unearthly
echoes:</p>

<p>"I am the shade of the master mariner whom ye did
foully murder off Matanzas and there is no rest for me
ten fathom down."</p>

<p>The apparitions flitted out of the shadow and were
vaguely disclosed in the flickering glare from the brimstone
pots. The smoke gave them a wavering aspect as
though their shapes were unsubstantial. Blackbeard
stood beholding them in a trance of horror. With an
aimless finger he traced the sign of the cross and his
pallid lips moved in the murmur:</p>

<p>"<i>The ghost o' Jesse Strawn! For the love of God,
forbear.</i>"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a petition as pious as ever Christian uttered.
Forgotten was his wicked counterfeit of the nether region.
Again the shrill voice wailed:</p>

<p>"Pity poor Jesse Strawn. I'll haunt ye by land and
sea, Cap'n Teach. Swear by the Book to let that treasure
chest lie at the bottom of the creek else I tear your
sinful soul from your body."</p>

<p>The terrible Blackbeard was incapable of motion.
Huskily he muttered:</p>

<p>"I'll ne'er seek the chest, good Jesse Strawn, an' it
please you to pass me by."</p>

<p>The two spectres moved forward as the one of the
deeper voice declaimed:</p>

<p>"Doomed I was to find no rest till I overtook your
ship, Ed'ard Teach. Each night you'll see me walk the
plank from your quarter-deck."</p>

<p>The unhappy Blackbeard gibbered something and
would have fled as the spirits approached him. But
those bandy legs tottered and before he could turn the
awful visitants were upon him. One raised a round
shot above his head, or so it appeared to be, and smote
him full upon the crown. The other whirled a flat
bludgeon and hit him on the jaw. With the smell of
brimstone was mingled the pungent flavor of ripe cheese
and salt-fish. Blackbeard measured his length, and the
ghost of Jesse Strawn delayed an instant to dump a pot
of sizzling combustibles over him.</p>

<p>Then the spirits twain made for the cabin at top<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
speed. Several of the crew had rushed down to harken
to the strange disturbance. They scattered wildly at
the first glimpse of these phantoms, being superstitious
sailormen with many a wicked deed to answer for.
It flashed into Joe Hawkridge's mind that all the men
of the watch might be chased below, the hatches clapped
on them, and the mastery of the brig secured. Blackbeard
was absent for reasons best known to himself and
his pirates lacked leadership. A brace of ghosts could
put them to panic rout. And, no doubt, that wailing
message of dead Jesse Strawn had carried like the cry
of a banshee.</p>

<p>The poop was deserted in the twinkling of an eye,
even to the pair of helmsmen and the officer of the watch.
Against the sky of night the unwelcome phantoms were
wan and luminous while the groans which issued from
them were enough to curdle the blood of the brawniest
pirate. He who had been Jack Cockrell in mortal guise
was quick to slide the cabin hatch closed and fasten it.
For the moment they had captured the armed brig
<i>Royal James</i> and as ferocious a crew of rascals as ever
scuttled a merchantman.</p>

<p>Joe Hawkridge glided to the taffrail and peered over
the stern. A boat was towing behind the ship. It had
been left there for taking soundings or pulling the brig's
head around while she was still in the shoaler waters
near the coast. This was better than Joe had dared anticipate.
Feeling his way along the rail, he found the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
end of the rope which was belayed around a wooden pin.
Heaven be praised, they would not have to swim for it!
He beckoned his comrade to say in his ear:</p>

<p>"They will soon find their wits. It 'ud be foolish to
try scaring 'em under hatches now that the jolly-boat
floats so handy. There's hard cases amongst 'em that
will begin shooting at us presently. Down the rope ye
go, Jack. I'll stand by and give 'em another dose of
poor Jesse Strawn."</p>

<p>Over the rail flew the stouter phantom of the two and
slid like a white streak, fetching up in the boat with a
most earthly and substantial thump. With a farewell
wail the other ghost flung a limber leg over and shot
down so fast that his hands were scorched. To such
pirates as beheld this instant vanishment, these disturbing
spirits floated off into space. Jack cut the rope
with his knife and the boat dropped back in the shining
wake. They shoved out two heavy oars and fairly broke
their hearts in pulling dead into the wind where the brig
would have to tack to pursue them.</p>

<p>The rattle of the oars and the discovery of the shorn
rope's end must have convinced the pirates who ran aft
that they had been tricked by mortal beings like themselves.
A musket spat a red streak of fire. Blocks
whined as the braces were hauled to change the brig's
course. In the light breeze she responded awkwardly
and soon hung in stays. Meanwhile the jolly-boat was
slowly working to windward while two frightened lads<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
tugged and swung until the flour turned to paste on
their dripping faces.</p>

<p>Before the brig began to forge ahead, the boat was invisible
from her decks. This was evident because the
spatter of musket-fire ceased. Soon the fugitives heard
Blackbeard's harsh voice damning all hands. That
thick skull of his had not been cracked by the impact of
the solid cheese and he had been released from his brimstone
inferno. The ghosts rested on their oars. They
could watch the glimmering canvas of the brig and see
what her procedure might be. Soon she filled away and
forsook the attempt to find the boat. Blackbeard had
wisdom enough to avoid blundering about and putting
the brig aground in a chase so elusive as this.</p>

<p>"Farewell, ye hairy son of Tophet," said Joe Hawkridge,
waving his hand at the disappearing vessel.
"And here's hoping I set your whiskers ablaze when I
turned the pot over 'em."</p>

<p>"Did you hear him swear not to touch the treasure
chest, Joe? That was a master stroke of yours."</p>

<p>"Aye, it was bright of me. But he thinks different
now. He knows we made a booby of him."</p>

<p>"But we learned one thing,&mdash;he hasn't recovered the
treasure yet," suggested Jack.</p>

<p>"He is such a powerful liar that I don't know as the
ghost o' Jesse Strawn could budge the truth out of him.
However, it was comfortin' to hear him swear it on his
marrow-bones. I fetched away the navigation chart,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the one I poached from the cabin table. It gives us the
lay o' the coast."</p>

<p>"What ho and whither bound?" was Jack's question.
"Here is a sail wound round a sprit beneath the
thwarts."</p>

<p>"The wrong wind to head for Cap'n Bonnet and the
<i>Revenge</i>. This swag-bellied jolly-boat handles like a
firkin. We had best wait for day and then decide the
voyage."</p>

<p>"Nothing to eat and no water, Joe. All I can find
is an empty pannikin."</p>

<p>"You're a glutton," severely exclaimed young
Hawkridge. "After the banquet I served in the hold!"</p>

<p>What Master Cockrell said in reply sounds as familiar
and as wistful to-day as when he spoke it two hundred
years ago.</p>

<p>"I have had enough of wandering and strange adventures,
Joe. I want to go home."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>MR. PETER FORBES MOURNS HIS NEPHEW</h3>


<div class='unindent'><big>I</big>T seems a long time, in the course of this story, since
the honorable Secretary of the Council, Mr. Peter
Arbuthnot Forbes, was forced to sail in to Charles
Town from the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i> on that most humiliating
errand of finding medicines for Blackbeard's
fever-smitten rogues. For the sake of his own dear
nephew and the other hostages detained on board, he
had endeavored to perform his bargain and was returning
across the bar when the threatening clouds and other
portents of a violent storm caused the seamen to lose
heart. They put about and drove back into the harbor
for shelter in the very nick of time.</div>

<p>These were pirates from Blackbeard's crew, it may
be recalled, with his grizzled, scarred boatswain at the
tiller. They had felt safe enough to swagger and ruffle
it through the streets of Charles Town and to terrify the
people. Their worthless lives were protected by the
hostages who waited in fear and trembling. The town
seethed with indignation and was hot with shame.
There would be no more of the friendly traffic with pirates.</p>

<p>It was fully believed that the wretched Blackbeard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
would be as good as his word in allowing no more than
two days' grace. Therefore when Mr. Peter Forbes
came back in the boat to inform his neighbors that he
had been unable to reach the ship, it was sadly taken for
granted that those helpless passengers had been put to
death. Forthwith the pirates of the boat's crew were
seized and thrown in gaol. There they lay in double
irons until the Council met and ordered them to be tried.
In accordance with the verdict the six seamen and the
boatswain were promptly hanged by the neck from the
same gallows at White Point hard by the town. And
the people no longer shivered at the name of Blackbeard
nor feared his vengeance. Their fighting blood was
thoroughly aroused.</p>

<p>Not long after this, there arrived from England a new
Governor of the Province, a man of honor and resolution
who approved what had been done. This Governor
Johnson proceeded to organize the town for defense,
building batteries on Sullivan's Island, recruiting the
seafaring men in the militia, and seeking to obtain merchant
vessels which could be employed as armed cruisers.
Learning that the Governor of North Carolina was in
a corrupt partnership with pirates, he sent messages to
Virginia to solicit co&ouml;peration.</p>

<p>This activity made much work for Secretary Peter
Forbes who forsook his intention of going to England to
beg the co&ouml;peration of his Majesty's Government
against the plague of pirates. Dapper and plump and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
important as of yore, his florid face was clouded with
sorrow and he seemed a much older man. He mourned
his nephew, Jack Cockrell, as no more and felt as
though he had lost an only son. Every angry word he
had ever addressed the lad, every hasty punishment inflicted,
hurt him grievously.</p>

<p>It was a solace to talk with winsome Dorothy Stuart
because hers was the bright optimism of youth and she
held so exalted an opinion of Jack's strength and courage
that she refused to abandon hope. And the fact that
he had confided to her his rash intention of running
away and signing as a pirate sooner than be transported
to school in England, persuaded her that he might be
alive.</p>

<p>"From what you saw yourself, Mr. Forbes," said
she, "when Blackbeard boarded the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>
with his dreadful men, our Jack won his fancy."</p>

<p>"So it appeared, Dorothy. The boy boasted of
knocking a tall pirate on the head, and he read this
monster of a pirate more shrewdly than I. Yes, Blackbeard
took it with rough good humor. But Jack would
ne'er consent to sail with him. 'Twas that confounded
Stede Bonnet with his gallant air that turned the lad's
head. He cast a glamor over this trade of murder and
pillage."</p>

<p>"Be that as it may," returned Dorothy, with a sigh
and a smile, "I confess to a romantic admiration for
this bold Captain Bonnet. He wears an air of mystery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
which is most becoming. We must not blame poor
Jack."</p>

<p>"No, no, I am done with all that," hastily exclaimed
Uncle Peter. "All I dare hope is that when Blackbeard
is captured, we may learn what fate befell the
boy. It makes the torture worse to have him vanish
without trace."</p>

<p>"And yet I have faith the sea will give him back to
us, Mr. Forbes. He will find you a chastened guardian,
not so apt to box his ears."</p>

<p>Uncle Peter was so distressed by this gentle raillery
that the girl begged pardon and vowed that she would
never again offend. It so happened that they were sitting
together in Parson Throckmorton's garden a day
or so after this when a friend came running in with
tidings the most unexpected and incredible. A negro
slave had come from a plantation a few miles inland
and he bore a letter written by none other than Captain
Jonathan Wellsby of the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>. It
narrated how he and the survivors of his ship had journeyed
that far after weeks of suffering and frequent
skirmishes with Indians. They were compelled to rest
and take shelter before undertaking the last stage of the
journey.</p>

<p>Councilor Peter Forbes was magically changed. He
shed his dignity and threw his hat in air. Clasping Miss
Dorothy's slender waist, he planted a kiss on her damask
cheek. Parson Throckmorton was ramming snuff into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
his nostrils, his wig all awry, while he sneezed trumpet
blasts of rejoicing.</p>

<p>"Survivors? <i>Kerchooh!</i> God bless me, that lusty
stripling will be amongst them,&mdash;<i>kerchooh</i>,&mdash;he can survive
anything but Greek and Latin,&mdash;<i>kerchooh</i>,&mdash;I will
spare the rod in future."</p>

<p>"I told you so, Uncle Peter Forbes," laughed
Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Not so fast," quoth he, in a mood suddenly sobered.
"Captain Wellsby includes no list of those in his
party."</p>

<p>"But, of course, one of them is <i>sure</i> to be Master
Jack," she insisted.</p>

<p>"I am a selfish man and a laggard officer of the
Crown," he exclaimed with air of great self-reproach.
"There are women in that company and wounded men,
no doubt. We must take them clothing, horses, food, a
surgeon."</p>

<p>He bustled off to the Governor's house to find that
energetic gentleman absent at Sullivan's Island. Acting
for him, the Secretary of the Council sent the town
crier to summon all good citizens to the tavern green.
In the space of an hour the men and supplies were assembled
and with Mr. Forbes in command the band of
mercy made haste to reach the plantation. During the
march there was a buzz of anxious surmise. Was this
one and that alive or dead? Had the hostages been
slain and were these the sailormen of the <i>Plymouth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Adventure</i> who had been set adrift by Blackbeard?
Councilor Forbes winced at hearing such talk as this,
but his heart beat high nevertheless, so confident was he
that he was about to behold his manly nephew.</p>

<p>There was loud cheering when they came to the
cleared land of the indigo fields and saw a tattered
British ensign fluttering from the log stockade which
enclosed the huts of the overseer and his laborers. In
the gateway appeared the stalwart figure of Captain
Wellsby in ragged garments and with a limping gait.
Other men crowded behind him and responded with
huzzas which were like a feeble echo. The friends from
Charles Town rushed forward to embrace them, loudly
demanding to know where the rest were.</p>

<p>"We fetched the women safe through," answered
Captain Wellsby whose eyes were sunken and the brown
beard streaked with gray. "Twelve good men of my
crew are dead, and three of the gentlemen passengers.
The swamps took toll of some and the Indians slew the
others. We were besieged a fortnight by the Yemassees,&mdash;a
hard experience all of it, and wondrous luck to
have escaped&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Councilor Forbes delayed while his companions entered
the huts to attend the invalids. He struggled to
ask a question but his voice was beyond control.</p>

<p>"I understand," kindly spoke the shipmaster.
"Your lad is not with us, nor can I say if he be dead
or alive."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Indians carried him off?" weakly inquired the
uncle.</p>

<p>"No, he was never seen after we abandoned ship.
Your Jack and a chum of his from Blackbeard's crew
were for making the beach on a small raft of their own
contrivance. This was after nightfall, Councilor, and
what with a land'ard breeze and a crotchety set of the
tide amongst the shoals, they floated out to sea."</p>

<p>"On a small raft," muttered Mr. Forbes, "and a
vast ocean. I know of no ship voyaging to or from
these ports which might have found them."</p>

<p>"I was in hopes of hearing news of the lads from
you," sorrowfully said the shipmaster. "There is the
chance, tiny though it be, that they were sighted by
some vessel bound to foreign parts, across the Western
Ocean."</p>

<p>The uncle shook his head in a manner profoundly dejected.
There were duties which summoned him and he
choked down his own grief, turning from the sympathetic
mariner to minister to those in distress. Horse
litters were soon ready for the exhausted but heroic
women who had been kept alive by the devotion of the
noble British seamen in accordance with the traditions
of the merchant service. Those unable to walk farther
were placed in carts. Clothed and fed, the sailors were
in blithe spirits and talked of going to sea again as soon
as they could find a ship.</p>

<p>In the crowd which met them on the outskirts of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Charles Town settlement was Dorothy Stuart. She
scanned the straggling column and then ran from one
cart to another. It was impossible to convince her that
Jack Cockrell was not there. But when she heard from
Uncle Peter the news that Jack was missing but not
surely dead, her faith burned anew, triumphant over
fact and reason.</p>

<p>"See how the great storm came to save him from
Blackbeard," she cried, her hand nestling in Uncle
Peter's arm. "And look how he came unscathed
through that bloody battle with the pirates in the
<i>Plymouth Adventure</i>. Why, a cruise on a raft is merely
a frolic after all that."</p>

<p>"I would not discourage your dear dreams, sweet
maid," was the gentle response. "And may they be
truer than my own forebodings."</p>

<p>Charles Town was more than ever resentful when it
learned from these poor people how the pirate sailing-master,
Ned Rackham, had plotted to get rid of them
and how mournful had been their sufferings after the
shipwreck. The one boat left to them had been too
rotten to send along the coast and they had plunged into
a wilderness almost impassable.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Governor Johnson, stirred by this episode,
had received word that the province of Virginia was
both ready and anxious to join in an expedition against
Blackbeard. Governor Spottswood of Virginia would
be outfitting such craft as he could get together in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
James River while he awaited a reinforcement from
Charles Town.</p>

<p>The best vessel available for immediate use was a
small brigantine, the <i>King George</i>. There was no lack
of eager seamen when Councilor Forbes and Colonel
Stuart proclaimed the muster on the tavern green.
Among those selected were several of Captain Jonathan
Wellsby's sailors who were primed to fight even though
there was not much flesh on their bones. He himself
was a forlorn mariner who had lost his good ship and
found no joy in life. With a grim smile of gratitude
he accepted the invitation to go as master of the <i>King
George</i>, with Colonel Stuart as a sea soldier to drill the
men and lead them in action.</p>

<p>It was while they were slinging guns aboard the
brigantine that some of the men happened to notice a
small boat coming into the harbor under a rag of sail.
At first it was taken for a fishing craft and there was
no comment until it was quite close. Then they saw
that it was a ship's jolly-boat much the worse for wear,
with only two occupants. These were half-naked lads,
burned black to the waist, with a queer kind of canvas
head-gear as a protection against the sun.</p>

<p>The boat was steered to pass under the stern of the
<i>King George</i> and the crew was unable to fathom if these
were pirates or victims of another shipwreck. Captain
Wellsby solved it by shouting:</p>

<p>"Both your guesses are right! One is the pirate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
younker that served our cause in the <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>
and t'other is Master Jack Cockrell!"</p>

<p>One of the Charles Town volunteers heard only the
word <i>pirate</i> and growled, with an oath:</p>

<p>"One o' Blackbeard's spawn? We'll make precious
short work of him. Hand me a musket and I will save
trouble for the hangman."</p>

<p>"Here, stop that," said Captain Wellsby, beckoning
his own men. "You old <i>Adventure</i> hands know better.
Quell these lubbers. If there's to be hostile feeling
ashore I shall take this lad aboard under my own protection."</p>

<p>During this argument the sea-worn pilgrims in the
jolly-boat had recognized the shipmaster and were joyfully
yelling at him. In response to his gesture, they
pulled down the sail and rowed to the gangway of the
brigantine. There was no need to fear the wrath of the
Charles Town seamen, because the <i>Adventure</i> hands
stood by as a guard while they explained how this young
Joe Hawkridge had valiantly helped to turn the tide of
battle against the prize crew of pirates. And there was
such a rousing welcome for Master Cockrell that all else
was forgotten. His old shipmates fairly mobbed him.</p>

<p>"I will fire a gun and hoist all the bunting to signal
the town," cried the skipper, his face shining. "And
presently I'll send you to the wharf in my own boat, but
first tell me, boys, who took you off the little raft and
whence come you in this ship's boat?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"Blackbeard rescued us. And we borrowed the boat
from him," demurely answered Jack, watching the effect
of this bombshell of a sensation.</p>

<p>"<i>Blackbeard!</i>" echoed the bedazed shipmaster and
the others chimed it like a chorus.</p>

<p>"Aye, old Buckets o' Blood hisself," grinned Joe
Hawkridge. "We had him tamed proper when we
parted company. First we chased him through a swamp
till his tongue hung out and left him mired to the whiskers.
Then for another lark we scared him in his
own ship so he begged us on his knees to forbear.
We learned Cap'n Ed'ard Teach his manners, eh,
Jack?"</p>

<p>This was too much for the audience which stood
agape. A dozen voices at once implored enlightenment.
With a lordly air for a youth whose costume was mostly
one leg of his breeches, Master Cockrell reproved them
to wit:</p>

<p>"Captain Stede Bonnet was more courteous to our
distress when we sailed with him. He gave us a thumping
big breakfast."</p>

<p>"Right-o," declared Joe. "'Tis our custom to spin
strange yarns for clothes and vittles in payment."</p>

<p>The men scampered to the galley and pantry but refused
to let Captain Wellsby carry these rare entertainers
into the cabin. Graciously they sketched the
chief events, omitting all mention of the treasure chest,
and Jack explained in conclusion:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"And so I was stricken homesick, like an illness, and
Joe had his fill of pirates, too. The wind was wrong to
rejoin Captain Bonnet in the Inlet harbor after we
shipped as ghosts in the jolly-boat, and we had a mariner's
chart of the Carolina coast and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what did you do for subsistence?" broke in
Captain Wellsby.</p>

<p>"Food and water?" answered Joe. "Oh, we landed
when the thirst plagued us too bad. And there was
rain to fill a bight of the sail and a pannikin to save it
in."</p>

<p>"And we lived on oysters mostly," said Jack, "and
Joe killed a fat opossum with a club, and we caught
some fish in a net which I knotted from a ball of marline
that was in the boat. And we foraged for pawpaws
and persimmons."</p>

<p>"And whenever the breeze was fair we put to sea
again," said Joe, "and it was a long and weary voyage,
though not so many leagues on the chart."</p>

<p>The captain's boat was ready and they tumbled in,
two wayfarers of the sea who were as lean and sun-dried
as the buccaneers of old Trimble Rogers' fond memories.
Hardships had seasoned and weathered them like good
ash staves. On the wharf was Uncle Peter Forbes and
Governor Johnson and a concourse of townspeople
drawn by the joyous signals flown from the brigantine.
Jack looked in vain for Dorothy Stuart and was thankful
that her welcome was deferred. Shears and a razor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
and Christian raiment would make him look less like a
savage from the coast of Barbary.</p>

<p>Uncle Peter wasted a vast deal of pity, thinking the
castaways too weak and wasted to walk. Jack strode
along with him, the crowd at their heels, and soon had
the plump Councilor puffing for breath. They insisted
on taking Joe Hawkridge with them although he was
for seeking lodgings at the tavern. He was one of the
household, declared Mr. Forbes, while Jack warned him
to beware of impertinence lest he be sentenced to chop
wood for the kitchen fire.</p>

<p>The neighbors and friends, as curious as they were
joyful, were barred from the house while the lads talked
and Uncle Peter carefully made notes of it all. It was
too much for him to realize that Jack was sitting there
lusty and laughing and with the dutifully respectful
manner as of yore, in spite of the man's part he had
played to the hilt. Of all the exploits, that which most
fascinated Mr. Peter Forbes was the chase after Blackbeard's
sea-chest weighty with treasure and the discovery
of the knoll in the Cherokee swamp where he might
have buried other booty. Here was a picaresque
romance which allured the methodical barrister and
Councilor and he was as boyishly excited as his nephew.
He examined the chart which Jack had copied from his
rude sketch made on a piece of bark and this raised a
question which he was quick to ask:</p>

<p>"What of Bill Saxby and this old bloodhound of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Trimble Rogers? As soon as Stede Bonnet could get
the <i>Revenge</i> to sea, I have no doubt he sailed to Cape
Fear River to get these pirate comrades of yours and
the seamen he left to find them. Once aboard, they
would urge Bonnet to return to Cherokee Inlet and let
them go hunt the treasure."</p>

<p>"That may be, but we can trust them to deal fair by
us," replied Jack.</p>

<p>"Possibly," was the skeptical comment. Mr. Forbes
was not too ready to believe in honest pirates.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure Cap'n Bonnet had a mind to bother
with this treasure hunting," suggested Joe Hawkridge.
"Leastwise, he may ha' put it off to an easier day. He
has friends that keep him well informed, such as the
Governor of North Carolina at Bath Town. And all
this flurry against piratin', here and in Virginia, 'ud be
apt to make Cap'n Bonnet wary of bein' trapped on the
coast."</p>

<p>"Joe is full of wisdom, as usual," said Master Cockrell.
"And if Blackbeard has cruised to the Spanish
Main, as we suspect, the treasure may lie undisturbed
for a while."</p>

<p>"Concerning Blackbeard, the evidence then in hand
warranted your conclusions," was Uncle Peter's judicial
comment, "but I have received later information. The
rumor is, and well-founded, that he turned his ship and
made for the Pamlico River with the intention of obtaining
pardon from the false and greedy Governor Eden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
This would baffle our plans against him, or so he would
assume. And it would enable him to remain within
convenient distance of his treasure."</p>

<p>"Would this Province and Virginia respect such a
pardon as that?" queried Jack.</p>

<p>"Not in the case of Blackbeard," snapped the Councilor,
"because we know it would be violated as soon as
this treacherous villain could safely return to his piracies."</p>

<p>"Then Joe and I will enlist in the <i>King George</i>
brigantine," cried Jack. "Captain Wellsby tells me
she will sail for Virginia inside the week."</p>

<p>Uncle Peter was about to make violent protest but
he checked himself and his emotions were torn betwixt
pride and yearning affection. He could not bear to let
his nephew go so soon to new perils, but what right had
he to try to shield him when the public duty called? It
was idle to pretend that Jack was too young and tender
to embark on such service as this. He was fitter for it
than some of the other volunteers. And so the unhappy
Uncle Peter walked the floor with his cheeks puffed out
and his hands clasped behind him and said, with a tremulous
sigh:</p>

<p>"I swore to treat you no more as a child, Jack. 'Tis
right and natural for you to desire to go in the <i>King
George</i> as a fighting man tried and true. As for Joe
Hawkridge, I have acquainted the Governor with
his merits and his pardon is assured."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thankee, sir," returned the reformed young pirate.
"A respectable life is what I crave, and the parson for
company."</p>

<p>"It sounds almost pleasant to me, including the parson,"
admitted Jack, "as soon as we shall have settled
this matter with Blackbeard."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>NED RACKHAM'S PLANS GO MUCH AMISS</h3>


<div class='unindent'><big>T</big>HE armed brigantine had been out several days
on the voyage to Virginia when a vessel was
sighted hull-down. Captain Wellsby and
Colonel Stuart decided to edge over and take a look at
the stranger although they were not anxious to engage
an enemy of heavier metal. If, however, this should
happen to be Blackbeard in the <i>Revenge</i> they were in
no mood to avoid him, despite the odds. After an hour
of sailing in a strong breeze, it was seen that this other
vessel was a small merchantman which shifted her course
as though to shake off pursuit.</div>

<p>"They take us for a pirate," chuckled Captain
Wellsby. "I have no wish to scare 'em, poor souls.
They will feel easy as soon as we bring the wind abeam."</p>

<p>He was about to give the order when Joe Hawkridge,
gunner's mate, called to Jack Cockrell standing his
watch at the helm:</p>

<p>"Remember the snow I told ye of? Yonder is the
same rig and tonnage, alike it as peas in a pod."</p>

<p>Jack spoke to the shipmaster who summoned Joe to
the quarter-deck. The boy was confident that this was
the New England coasting vessel in which Ned Rack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>ham
and his pirates had appeared off Cherokee Inlet
and had carried the marooned seamen from the sandy
cay.</p>

<p>"A brown patch in the big main-topsail, and the bowsprit
steeved more'n ordinary," said Joe. "Tit for tat,
Cap'n Wellsby. Your men can have the fun of jamming
them in the fo'castle. And you won't find me or
Jack helpin' these picaroons to break out."</p>

<p>"No fear of that," sternly spoke the shipmaster.
"They shall make their exit with a taut rope and a long
drop when I deliver them in Virginia."</p>

<p>It was to be gathered that the bold Ned Rackham had
failed in his desperate enterprise of capturing a larger
ship and that he was probably cruising up the coast in
hopes of rejoining Blackbeard. The snow had too few
guns to cope with the <i>King George</i> brigantine which
could throw a battering broadside. As soon as identification
was certain, Captain Wellsby hauled to windward
to hold the weather gauge and Colonel Stuart
called the men to quarters. The <i>Plymouth Adventure</i>
hands were disappointed that they would be unable to
pay their own grudge. They had no doubt that Ned
Rackham would strike his colors without a battle.</p>

<p>The <i>King George</i> ran close enough for Captain
Wellsby to shout through the trumpet:</p>

<p>"The snow ahoy! Send your men aboard or I'll sink
you. No tricks, Rackham. Lively, now."</p>

<p>They saw the men running to cut the boat lashings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
and struggle to launch the boats from the deck. Ned
Rackham, handsome and debonair, stared coolly at the
brigantine but gave no sign that he had heard the ultimatum.
With a shrug he walked across the poop,
glanced up at the British ensign which flew from his
main truck, and made no motion to pull it down.</p>

<p>"Blow your matches, boys," roared Colonel Stuart
from his station in the waist of the <i>King George</i>. "Five
minutes' grace, no more."</p>

<p>Captain Wellsby said to wait a little. The pirates
were endeavoring to quit the snow. And presently
Rackham appeared to change his own purpose. No
longer ignoring the <i>King George</i>, he doffed his hat in a
graceful flourish and bowed with a mocking obeisance.
Then he strolled to the cabin hatch and went below,
presumably to get a change of clothing or something
of the sort. But he failed to reappear and his men
were in a frenzy of haste, with one boat already in the
water.</p>

<p>So incensed was Colonel Stuart by the insolent refusal
of Ned Rackham to strike his colors in token of
surrender that he gave orders to fire at the mainmast
and try to bring it down. An instant before the starboard
battery thundered, the snow seemed to fly upwards
in a tremendous explosion. The masts were flung
out of her and the hull opened like a shattered basket.
So violent was the shock that men were thrown to the
deck of the <i>King George</i> and she quivered as though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
her bows had rammed a reef. Black smoke spouted
as from a crater and debris rained down on a boiling
sea.</p>

<p>A few survivors, scorched or half-stunned, were clinging
to bits of wreckage and wailing for succor. Where
the snow had floated was a discolored eddy, broken timbers,
a lather of dirty foam. Captain Jonathan Wellsby
picked himself up, rubbed a bump on his head, and
gazed wildly at the tragic scene. Collecting his wits,
he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"That 'ud be like Ned Rackham, to blow up the ship
sooner than be taken and hanged. More than likely he
had the train all laid to the powder barrels."</p>

<p>"He saved us a lot of trouble," said Colonel Stuart
as he climbed to the poop. "A fellow of iron will and
courage, this Rackham, by all accounts. I have conceived
a respect for him."</p>

<p>"I forgive him his sins," replied the skipper. "Now,
lads, boats away, and fish up those dying wretches."</p>

<p>Joe Hawkridge emitted a jubilant whoop and dived
over the rail without waiting for a boat. He had caught
a glimpse of a feeble swimmer whose square, solid features
and bushy brows were familiar. It was Peter
Tobey, the carpenter's mate, who had befriended him on
the cay and who had set adrift that miraculous cask of
food and water. A few strokes and Joe was at his side,
clutching him by the neck-band and towing him toward
the <i>King George</i> like a faithful retriever. Ropes were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
flung to them and Joe saw his good friend safely aboard
before he went up the side.</p>

<p>The carpenter's mate was both burned and bruised
but his hurts were not grievous and he was able to drag
himself aft with Joe as a crutch.</p>

<p>"My own particular prize, sir, by your gracious
leave," said Joe Hawkridge, addressing Captain
Wellsby. "This is Mr. Peter Tobey, a poor, faint-hearted
pirate like me. May I have him to keep,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Bless me, but there will be no pirates left to hang,"
was the quizzical reply. "Master Cockrell has adopted
you, and now I am ordered to be kind to Bill Saxby and
Trimble Rogers if I meet up with 'em."</p>

<p>"That's the whole list, sir. Ask Jack Cockrell. You
can string the rest of the bloody pirates to the yardarm,
for all we care. Do I get exemption for this Peter
Tobey?"</p>

<p>"What is your verdict, Colonel Stuart?" asked the
captain.</p>

<p>"I heard the tale from Hawkridge," answered the
brusque but generous soldier. "The carpenter's mate
has won my allegiance. What say you in your own behalf,
Peter Tobey?"</p>

<p>The blistered, singed survivor touched a hand to his
forehead and respectfully responded:</p>

<p>"A carpenter by trade and nature, and allus was. I
never see one happy day a-piratin' nor did I shed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
blood of any human creatur'. With a bench and
tools, you will find me a proper handy man in Charles
Town."</p>

<p>"That clinches it," cried Colonel Stuart. "I should
call it a crime to hang an artisan like Peter Tobey.
Your prize is awarded you, Hawkridge. See that he is
well cared for."</p>

<p>"The first booty that ever was handed me from a
sinkin' ship," said Joe. "Come along, Master Tobey,
and roll into my bunk."</p>

<p>"Verily I was castin' bread upon the waters when I
gave that cask to the wind and tide," devoutly murmured
the carpenter's mate as he limped below with his
new owner.</p>

<p>No more than a dozen other pirates were rescued alive
and several of these expired soon after they were lifted
aboard the brigantine. This was the only sensational
incident of the coastwise voyage to the James River.
Comfortably quartered, with no more work than was
wholesome, Jack Cockrell and Joe Hawkridge thought
it a holiday excursion after their previous adventures at
sea.</p>

<p>In the roadstead of the James were two men-of-war,
small frigates flying the broad pennant of the Royal
Navy. A conference was held in the cabin of the senior
officer, to which Captain Wellsby and Colonel Stuart
were invited. The latest advices made it seem certain
that Blackbeard still lurked off the coast of the Caro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>linas.
Planters had reported seeing his ship in Pamlico
Sound and it was also learned that he had been in communication
with the disloyal Governor Eden at Bath
Town. A letter had been intercepted, in handwriting
of the Governor's secretary, and addressed to Captain
Teach, which included these words:</p>

<p>"<i>I have sent you four of your men. They are all I
can meet with about town. Be upon your guard.</i>"</p>

<p>This was readily construed to mean that Blackbeard
was in haste to recall such of his crew as had strayed
ashore. At the council of war in the frigate's cabin, a
proclamation was read. It offered a handsome reward
for the capture of Captain Edward Teach, dead or alive,
and lesser rewards for other pirates.</p>

<p>It was the decision that the two frigates were unhandy
for cruising inshore. Therefore officers and men would
be chosen from them to fill the complements of two
sloops, light and active craft which would be unhampered
by batteries of cannon. They would be employed
for boarding Blackbeard's ship while the Charles Town
brigantine <i>King George</i> should convoy them and engage
in the attack if the depth of water should permit.
The naval officer selected to command the sloops was
Lieutenant Maynard who went off to the <i>King George</i>
to inspect her and make a call of courtesy.</p>

<p>He was especially cordial to Master Cockrell and
Gunner's Mate Joe Hawkridge, laying aside the stiff
dignity of naval rank. To his persuasive argument that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
they enter the royal service with promise of quick promotion,
they turned a deaf ear although they were wonderfully
taken with him. He was a gentle, soft-spoken
young man with a boyish smile who blushed when
pressed to talk of his own exploits against the Spanish,
the Dutch, and the French in Britannia's wooden walls.
His own questions were mostly about Blackbeard's
fighting quality. Would he make a stand against disciplined
tars who were accustomed to close in, hammer-and-tongs?
Joe Hawkridge answered to this:</p>

<p>"I ne'er saw him in action against a king's ship, and
all his wild nonsense is apt to delude ye into thinkin' him
a drunken play-actor. But you will never take him
alive, so long as those bandy legs have strength to prop
him up."</p>

<p>"I look forward to meeting him with a deal of pleasure.
It may be my good fortune to measure swords
with him," observed Lieutenant Maynard.</p>

<p>Joe Hawkridge was puzzled by this gentle fire-eater
with the complexion of a girl. Nothing could have been
more unlike the ramping, roaring pirates of Blackbeard's
dirty crew who tried to terrify by their very appearance.
After the lieutenant had returned to his
frigate, Jack Cockrell remarked:</p>

<p>"A most misleading man, Joe. You cannot picture
him seeking the bubble reputation at the cannon's
mouth, as Will Shakespeare saith."</p>

<p>"Blackbeard will bite him in two," replied Joe. "He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
is too pretty to be risked in such a slaughter pen. I
own up to feelin' squeamish on my own account, hardy
pirate though I be."</p>

<p>"This Lieutenant Maynard is welcome to measure
swords with Blackbeard," said Jack, "and I shall not
quarrel with him for the honor. Pick me a pirate with
a wooden leg, Joe, or one that still shakes with Spanish
fever."</p>

<p>"My only chance of getting out with a whole skin
is to lug a sack of flour under one arm and play the ghost
o' Jesse Strawn."</p>

<p>Expeditiously the brigantine and the two sloops sailed
out of the James River to head for the North Carolina
coast and first rake the nooks and bays of Pamlico
Sound. There was no intention of offering Blackbeard
fair odds in battle. With men and vessels enough it was
resolved to exterminate him, like ridding a house of rats
or other vermin. If he had gone out to sea, then the
pursuers would wait and watch for his return to his
favorite haunts in these waters. There was every reason
to believe, however, that he was concealed inshore, within
easy distance of his friend Governor Eden.</p>

<p>Failing to find him in Pamlico Sound, it was debated
whether to cruise farther to the southward. Now Master
Jack Cockrell and his chum had said nothing to the
officers concerning the treasure in the Cherokee swamp.
They felt bound in honor not to reveal it without the
consent of Bill Saxby and old Trimble Rogers who were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
partners in the enterprise. Moreover, Lieutenant Maynard
and the Virginia officers would feel bound to turn
the treasure over to the crown or its representatives.
Governor Eden of North Carolina would undoubtedly
claim it as found within his territory and this meant that
he would steal most of it for himself.</p>

<p>It thrilled the lads when Colonel Stuart told them
that this Provincial squadron would cruise as far as
Cherokee Inlet before working to the northward again.
Information had led the officers to believe that Blackbeard
had lost many men by desertion while his ship lay
at Bath Town and near by. They had been roving about
the plantations and making a nuisance of themselves
and seemed ready to quit their red-handed despot of a
master. In this event he might have sought his old
hiding-place at the Inlet sooner than risk a clash with
the force which had been sent after him and of which
he had been warned by Governor Eden.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Maynard scouted in advance with the two
sloops because there was small danger of their getting
aground and they could be moved along with oars if the
wind failed. The brigantine kept further offshore but
within signaling distance. She was running within sight
of the scattering barrier of low islands when Captain
Wellsby summoned Joe Hawkridge and informed
him:</p>

<p>"You will act as pilot, Joe, once we fetch sounding
on the Twelve Fathom Bank. The chart is faulty, as ye<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
know, and me and my mates are in strange waters with
a'mighty little elbow-room. You know the marks, I
take it."</p>

<p>"Aye, sir, I do that," answered Joe. "Then I stays
aboard ship and miss the chance to go pokin' about with
a cutlass? I'm all screwed up to terrible deeds, Cap'n
Wellsby, after a spell o' mortal fear. And who takes
care of Master Cockrell if he goes in a boat?"</p>

<p>"His own lusty right arm, Joe. Avast with your
melancholy. We must first catch this Blackbeard."</p>

<p>Presently Joe Hawkridge footed it up the main
shrouds to scan the sea ahead and try to get a glimpse
of that sandy bit of exposed shoal on which he had been
marooned. This would enable him to find the entrance
to the outer channel and so con the brigantine in from
seaward. While he shaded his eyes with his hand
against the glare of the morning sun, one of the sloops
hoisted a string of bright signal flags and fired two guns.
The other sloop was seen to lower her topsail and wait
for the <i>King George</i> to come up.</p>

<p>Joe Hawkridge climbed higher and found a perch
where he could discern the spars of a vessel etched almost
as fine as threads against the azure horizon. He
was almost certain that the ship he saw was very close
to that tiny cay of which he had such unhappy knowledge.
Soon he was able to perceive that the vessel's sails
were furled. This was an odd place for an anchorage.
His conjecture was confirmed when the <i>King George</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
passed close to the nearest sloop and Lieutenant Maynard
shouted:</p>

<p>"Stranded hard and fast! And she is deucedly like
Blackbeard's brig."</p>

<p>Scampering to the deck, Joe Hawkridge mustered
his gun's crew as Jack Cockrell came running up to say:</p>

<p>"Trapped on the very islet where he cast you and
the other pirates! His chickens have come home to
roost."</p>

<p>"Call me no pirate or I'll stretch ye with a handspike,"
grinned Joe. "'Tis a plaguey poor word in
this company. Aye, Cap'n Ed'ard Teach has a taste
of his own medicine and he will get a worse dose this day
than ever he served me."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>THE GREAT FIGHT OF CAPTAIN TEACH</h3>


<div class='unindent'><big>Y</big>ES, there was Blackbeard's ship hard in the sand
which had gripped her keel while she was steering
to enter the Cherokee Inlet. There was no
pearly vapor of swamp mist out here to shroud her from
attack. The air was clear and bright, with a robust
breeze which stirred a flashing surf on the shoals. Under
lower sails, the two sloops watchfully crept nearer
until their crews could examine the stranded brig and
read the story of her plight. She stood on a slant with
the decks sloped toward the enemy. This made it impossible
to use her guns with any great effect.</div>

<p>Captain Wellsby tacked ship and kept the <i>King
George</i> well away from the cay, as Joe Hawkridge advised.
With an ebbing tide, it was unsafe to venture
into shallower water in order to pound Blackbeard's
vessel with broadsides. Lieutenant Maynard came
aboard in a small boat and was quite the dandy with his
brocaded coat and ruffles and velvet small-clothes. One
might have thought he had engaged to dance the minuet.
Colonel Stuart met him in a spick-and-span uniform of
His Majesty's Foot, cross-belts pipe-clayed white as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
snow, boots polished until they shone. Such gentlemen
were punctilious in war two hundred years ago.</p>

<p>"Your solid shot will not pound him much at this
range, my good sir," said the lieutenant. "With his
hull so badly listed toward us, you can no more than
splinter the decks while his men take shelter below."</p>

<p>"I grant you that," regretfully replied the soldier.
"And case-shot will not scatter to do him much harm.
Shall I blaze away and demoralize the rascals whilst you
make ready your boats?"</p>

<p>"Toss a few rounds into the varlets, Colonel Stuart.
It may keep them from massing on deck. One boat
from your ship, if it please you, with twenty picked men.
I shall take twenty men from each sloop as boarders."</p>

<p>"Sixty in all?" queried the colonel. "Why not take
a hundred?"</p>

<p>"They would be tumbling over one another,&mdash;too
much confusion. This is not a large vessel yonder. We
must have room on deck to swing and cut."</p>

<p>"I will have my men away in ten minutes, Lieutenant
Maynard," crisply replied the blonde, raw-boned Scotsman
with a finger at his hat-brim in courteous salute.
He proceeded to call the men by name, strapping, sober
fellows who had followed the sea amid the frequent
perils of the merchant service. Jack Cockrell was the
only landsman and he felt greatly honored that he
should be included. Gone was his unmanly trepidation.
Was he more worthy to live than these humble seamen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
who fought to make the ocean safer for other voyagers,
who were true kinsmen of the Elizabethan heroes of
blue water? He tarried a moment to wring Joe Hawkridge's
hand in farewell and to tell him:</p>

<p>"If I have ill luck in this adventure, old comrade,&mdash;do
you mind presenting my best compliments, and&mdash;and
a fond farewell to Mistress Dorothy Stuart?"</p>

<p>"Strike me, Jack, stow that or you'll have me blubberin',"
said Joe. "Bring me a lock of Cap'n Teach's
whiskers as a token for my lass in Fayal if ever I clap
eyes on her again. And you'd best take this heavy cutlass
which I whetted a-purpose for ye. 'Twill split a
pirate like slicin' an apple."</p>

<p>With this useful gift in his hand, Master Cockrell
swung himself into the boat where Colonel Stuart stood
in the stern-sheets. Perhaps he, too, was dwelling on a
fair maid named Dorothy who might be left fatherless
before the sun climbed an hour higher. The sloops were
moving nearer the cay under sail and oar, trailing their
crowded boats behind them. Blackbeard had hauled
two or three of his guns into such positions that he could
open fire but the sloops crawled doggedly into the shoal
water and so screened their boats until these were ready
to cast off for the final dash.</p>

<p>It was a rare sea picture, the stranded brig with canvas
loose on the yards and ropes streaming, her listed
decks a-swarm with pirates in outlandish, vari-colored
garb, the surf playing about her in a bright dazzle and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the gulls screaming overhead. The broad, squat figure
of Blackbeard himself was never more conspicuous. He
no longer strutted the quarter-deck but was all over the
ship, menacing his men with his pistols, shifting them in
groups for defense, shouldering bags of munitions, or
heaping up the grenades and stink-pots to be lighted
and thrown into the attacking boats.</p>

<p>It was his humor to adorn himself more elaborately
than usual. Under his broad hat with the great feather
in it he had stuck lengths of tow matches which were all
sputtering and burning so that he ran to and fro in a
cloud of sparks and smoke like that Evil One whom he
professed to admire. He realized, no doubt, that this
was likely to be his last stand. The inferno which he
was so fond of counterfeiting, fairly yawned at his feet.</p>

<p>And now the sloops let go their anchors while from
astern of them appeared the three boats of the assailants.
They steered wide of each other to seek different parts
of the pirate brig and so divide Blackbeard's force. The
boats of Colonel Stuart and Lieutenant Maynard were
racing for the honor of first place alongside. Blackbeard
trained two guns on them, filled with grape and
chain-shot, and one boat was shattered but it swam long
enough for the cheering men to pull it to the brig and
toss their grapples to the rail which was inclined quite
close to the water. They were in the surf which broke
against the ship, but this was a mere trifle.</p>

<p>Most of them went up the side like cats, leaping for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the chains and dead-eyes, slashing at the nettings, swinging
by a rope's end, or digging their toes in a crack of a
gun-port. Forward they were pouring over the bowsprit,
vaulting like acrobats from the anchor stocks, or
swarming up the stays. It seemed beyond belief that
they could gain footing on the decks with Blackbeard's
demons stabbing and hacking and shooting at them, but
in such manner as this was many a great sea fight won
in the brave days of old.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Maynard gained his lodgment in the bows
amid a swirl of pirates who tried to pen him in front of
the forecastle house. But his tars of the Royal Navy
were accustomed to close quarters and they straightway
made room for themselves. Chest to chest and hand to
hand they hewed their way toward the waist of the ship
where Colonel Stuart raged like the braw, bonny Highlander
that he was. Almost at the same time, the third
boat had made fast under the jutting stern gallery and
its twenty men were piling in through the cabin windows
like so many human projectiles.</p>

<p>In the <i>King George</i> brigantine, Captain Jonathan
Wellsby fidgeted and gnawed his lip, with a telescope at
his eye, while he watched the conflict in which he could
scarce distinguish friend from foe. He could see Blackbeard
charge aft to rally his men and then whirl back to
lunge into the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e where towered Colonel Stuart's tall
figure. The powder smoke from pistols and muskets
drifted in a thin blue haze. Joe Hawkridge was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
fairly shaking with nervousness as he said to the skipper:</p>

<p>"There'll be no clearing the decks 'less they down
that monster of a Cap'n Teach. And he has more lives
than a cat. See you my dear crony, Master Jack?"</p>

<p>"No, I cannot make him out in that mad turmoil,"
replied Captain Wellsby. "Nip and tuck, I call it,
Joe."</p>

<p>This was the opinion forced upon Lieutenant Maynard
as he saw the engagement resolve itself into a series
of bloody whirlpools, his seamen and the pirates intermingled.
He won his way past the forecastle into the
wider spaces of the deck, with only a few of his twenty
tars on their feet. Colonel Stuart was hard pressed and
the boarders who had come over the stern had as much as
they could do to hold their own. Thus far the issue was
indecisive.</p>

<p>Jack Cockrell had kept close to the colonel, and felt
amazement that he was still alive. His cheek was laid
open, a bullet had torn his thigh, and a powder burn
streaked his neck, but he felt these hurts not at all. It
was a nightmare from which there seemed no escape.
He saw Blackbeard rush at him with a raucous shout of:</p>

<p>"The scurvy young cockerel! He will ne'er crow
again."</p>

<p>Colonel Stuart sprang between them, blades clashed,
and they were swept apart in another wave of jostling
combat. A moment later the colonel slipped and fell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
as a coal-black negro chopped at him with a broken cutlass.
Jack Cockrell flew at him and they wrestled until
a hip-lock threw the negro to the deck, where the colonel
made him one pirate less.</p>

<p>Formidable as these outlaws were, they lacked the
stern cohesion which had been drilled into the sailors of
the Royal Navy and likewise learned in the hard school
of the merchant service. Very slowly the odds were
shifting against Blackbeard's crew. It was unmistakable
when Lieutenant Maynard cut his way through to
join Colonel Stuart, while the third group of boarders
was advancing little by little from the after quarter.
This meant that the force was gradually uniting in spite
of the furious efforts to scatter it.</p>

<p>And now there came an episode which lives in history
two centuries after that scene of carnage on the decks of
the stranded brig. It has preserved the name of a
humble lieutenant of the Royal Navy and saved it from
the oblivion which is the common lot of most brave men
who do and dare when duty beckons.</p>

<p>Blackbeard was bleeding from a dozen wounds and
yet his activity was unabated. He was like a grizzly
bear at bay. His men began to believe that his league
with Satan, of which he obscenely boasted, had made him
invulnerable. He was all that he had proclaimed himself
to be, the wickedest and most fearsome pirate of the
Western Ocean. And all the while, the slender, boyish
Lieutenant Maynard, sailor and gentleman, had one aim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
in mind, and that was to slay Captain Edward Teach
with his own hand. Nor was he at all content until he
had cleared a path to where the hairy pirate was playing
havoc with his broadsword.</p>

<p>With a loud laugh in mockery, Blackbeard snatched a
loaded pistol from one of his men and fired at this foppish
young officer who presumed to single him out. The
ball chipped Maynard's ear and he dodged the pistol
which was hurled at his head. It was curious to note a
lull in the general engagement, a little interval of suspense
while men regained their breath or tried to staunch
their wounds. They were unconsciously awaiting the
verdict of this duel between their leaders. Jack Cockrell,
for instance, finding himself alone by some chance,
leaned against a stanchion and heard his own blood drip&mdash;drip&mdash;on
the deck.</p>

<p>It was a fleeting respite. Blackbeard swung his
sword, with the might of those wide shoulders behind it.
The lieutenant stepped aside like lightning and the
bright weapon whistled past his arm. Then they went
at each other like blacksmiths, sparks flying as steel bit
steel. Dexterity and a cool wit were a match for the
pirate's untamable strength. Gory, snarling, Blackbeard
shortened his stroke to use the point. The lieutenant
dropped to one knee, thrust upward, and found a
vital spot.</p>

<p>Blackbeard stood staring at him with wonder in his
eyes. Then those thick, bowed legs gave way and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
toppled like a tree uprooted. He passed out quietly
enough, with no more cursing, and in this last moment
of sensibility his thoughts appeared to wander far to his
youth as a brisk merchant seaman out of Bristol port,
for he was heard to mutter, with a long sigh:</p>

<p>"A pretty babe as ever was, Mollie, and the mortal
image of its mother."</p>

<p>To his waist the sable beard covered him like a pall
and one corded arm was flung across his breast and it
showed the design of the skull and cross-bones pricked
in India ink. Then as if the dead leader had issued the
command, the surviving pirates began to fling down
their weapons and loudly cry for quarter. They need
not have felt ashamed of the resistance they had made
up to this time, but now the delirium of combat had
slackened and Blackbeard was no more. One or two of
his officers were alive and they knew that the game was
lost. Reinforcements could be sent from the sloops and
the brigantine as soon as they were signaled for. And
there was no flight from a stranded ship. Blackbeard
had been able to infuse them with his own madness.
Better chance the gallows than no quarter.</p>

<p>Here and there a few of the most desperate dogs of
the Spanish Main who had followed Blackbeard's fortunes
a long time, refused to surrender but they were
either shot down or overpowered. Captain Wellsby
was sending off two boats from the <i>King George</i> with
his surgeon, and the sloops were kedging in closer to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
cay with the rising tide. Half the seamen were beyond
aid and of the pirates no more than twenty were alive.
Jack Cockrell was thankful to have come off so lightly,
and he consoled himself with the notion that a scar across
his cheek would be a manly memento. Colonel Stuart
had been several times wounded but 'tis hard killing a
Highlander.</p>

<p>It was Lieutenant Maynard's duty to offer public
proof that he had slain none other than the infamous
Blackbeard, wherefore he made no protest when his armorer
hacked off the head of the dead pirate. There
was no feeling of chivalry due a fallen foe, valiant
though his end had been. This horrid trophy was tied
at the end of a sloop's bowsprit, to be displayed for the
gratification of all honest sailormen who might behold it
in port. It was not a gentle age on blue water and
Captain Edward Teach had been the death of many
helpless people during his wicked career.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Maynard announced that he would take
the two sloops into Bath Town, before proceeding to
Virginia, as they were overcrowded vessels and the survivors
of the boarding party needed proper care ashore.
It would also afford the unscrupulous Governor Eden
of North Carolina an opportunity to see his friend, Captain
Teach, as a pirate who would divide no more plundered
merchandise with him.</p>

<p>The brigantine <i>King George</i> was ready to escort them
into Pamlico Sound, after which she would sail for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Charles Town. Before the departure from the entrance
of Cherokee Inlet, the stranded vessel was set afire and
blazed grandly as the funeral pyre of Blackbeard's stout
lads who would go no more a-roving.</p>

<p>Never was a nurse more devoted than Joe Hawkridge
when his comrade was mercifully restored to him. Jack
was woefully pale and weak but in blithe spirits and
thankful to have seen the last of Blackbeard.</p>

<p>"Hulled in the leg and a damaged figger-head," said
Joe, as he sat on the edge of the hero's bunk. "Triflin',
I call it, when I expected to see you come aboard feet
first wrapped in a bit o' canvas."</p>

<p>"I don't want to talk about it, Joe. Let's find something
pleasant. Ho for Charles Town, and the green
trees and a bench in the shade."</p>

<p>"And a tidy little vessel after a while, you and me and
the Councilor a-pleasurin' up the coast with men and
gear to fish up the treasure chest."</p>

<p>"And you believe that Blackbeard never got back to
the Inlet to save the treasure for himself?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"Not the way his ship was headed when she struck the
shoal."</p>

<p>The brigantine was well on her way to Charles Town
when Captain Wellsby found that Master Cockrell
could be carried into the comfortable main cabin to rest
on a cushioned settle for an hour or two at a time. It
was during one of these visits, when Joe Hawkridge was
present, that the skipper remembered to say:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here is a bit of memorandum which may entertain
you lads. Lieutenant Maynard had Blackbeard's quarters
searched before the brig was burned. Some valuable
stuff was found, but nothing what you'd call a
pirate's treasure."</p>

<p>The lads looked at each other but kept their own
counsel and Captain Wellsby went on to explain:</p>

<p>"There was a private log, Blackbeard's own journal,
with a few entries in it, and most of the leaves torn out.
I made a copy of what could be read, for the late Captain
Teach was a better pirate than scrivener. Here,
Jack, you are the scholar."</p>

<p>Jack read aloud this extract, which was about what
might have been expected:</p>

<p>"<i>Such a day! Rum all out,&mdash;our company somewhat
sober. A confusion amongst us,&mdash;rogues a-plotting&mdash;great
talk of separation. So I looked sharp for a
prize. Took one, with a great deal of liquor on board,
so kept the company hot, very hot. Then all things
went well again.</i>"</p>

<p>"That sounds familiar enough to me," was Joe
Hawkridge's comment. "And the rest of his writing
will be much like it."</p>

<p>"Not so fast," exclaimed Captain Wellsby. "Scan
the next page, Jack. 'Twill fetch you up all standing.
Not that it puts gold in our pockets, for we know not
where to search, but I swear it will make your eyes
sparkle and your mouth water."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>Trying to hide his excitement, Jack saw a kind of
rough inventory, and it ran like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">"Where I Hid Itt This Cruse:<br />

<div class='hang1'>1 Bag 54 Silver Barrs. 1 Bag 79 Barrs &amp;
Peaces of Silver.</div>

<div class='hang1'>1 Bag Coyned Gold. 1 Bag Dust Gold. 2 Bags
Gold Barrs.</div>

<div class='hang1'>1 Bag Silver Rings &amp; Sundry Precious Stones.
3 Bags Unpolyshed Stones.</div>

<div class='hang1'>1 Silver Box set with Diamonds. 4 Golden
Lockets.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Also 1 Silver Porringer&mdash;2 Gold Boxons&mdash;7
Green Stones&mdash;Rubies Great &amp; Small 67&mdash;P'cl
Peaces of Eight &amp; Dollars&mdash;Also 1 Bag
Lump Silver&mdash;a Small Chaine&mdash;a corral Necklace&mdash;1
Bag English Crowns."</div></div>

<p>Captain Jonathan Wellsby listened to this luscious
recital with an air of mild amusement. He was of a
temper too stolid and sensible to waste his time on random
treasure hunting. Blackbeard might have chosen
his hiding-place anywhere along hundreds of leagues of
coast. He could understand the agitation of these two
adventurous lads to whom this memorandum was like a
magic spell. Of such was the spirit of youth.</p>

<p>"Any more of it?" demanded Joe Hawkridge.</p>

<p>"The next page was ripped out of the journal," answered
the skipper. "What cruise did he mean? If it
was this last one, he may have hid it on the Virginia or
Carolina coast."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Master Cockrell gave it as an excuse that he had sat
up long enough and would return to his bunk. He was
fairly bursting for a conference with Joe, and as soon as
they were alone he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It may be the sea-chest! What do you think?"</p>

<p>"A handsome clue, I call it, something to warm the
cockles of your heart," grinned the sea urchin. "Aye,
Jack, I should wager he wrote that down whilst he lay
at anchor in Cherokee Inlet."</p>

<p>"It seems shabby of us to keep the secret from Captain
Wellsby, but there is an obligation on us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To Bill Saxby and the old sea wolf," said Joe.
"We'll not forget this trump of a skipper when it comes
to splittin' up the treasure."</p>

<p>"I am anxious for Captain Bonnet and his crew," remarked
Jack. "With this crusade against pirates
afoot, our friends may be hanged before we see them
again."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>THE OLD BUCCANEER IS LOYAL</h3>


<div class='unindent'><big>S</big>ORROW mingled with rejoicing when the <i>King
George</i> brigantine sailed into Charles Town harbor.
The sea fight off Cherokee Inlet had taken
a heavy toll of brave seamen and there were vacant
chairs and aching hearts ashore, but the fiendish Blackbeard
had been blotted out and would no more harry the
coast. Small and rude as was this pioneer settlement,
it was most fair and attractive to the eyes of young Master
Cockrell and Joe Hawkridge. In the house of
Uncle Peter Forbes they rested at their ease and
planned sedate careers for themselves.</div>

<p>Even the treasure ceased to be uppermost in their
lively discussions. It could wait a while. They were
no longer under the spell of its influence. This different
world in which they now dwelt so contentedly made
their adventures seem like shadowy figments with precious
little romance in them. And neither lad expressed
any great anxiety to go exploring the noisome Cherokee
swamp and to challenge the ghost of Blackbeard.</p>

<p>Without a sign of rebellion, Jack returned to his
books and lessons in Parson Throckmorton's garden.
The learning already acquired he began to pass on to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Joe Hawkridge, who was a zealous pupil and determined
to read and write and cipher without letting the
grass grow under his feet. It was this young pirate's
ambition to make a shipping merchant of himself, and
Councilor Forbes found him employment in a warehouse
where the planters traded their rice, resin, and
indigo for the varied merchandise brought out from
England. Jack aspired to manage his uncle's plantation
and to acquire lands of his own and some day to sit
in the Governor's Council.</p>

<p>Of a Sunday morning he went to the little English
church, dressed in his best and using a cane, for he
limped from the wound in his thigh. Joe Hawkridge
walked with him, careful to banish his grin, and sat in
the Councilor's pew where he paid proper attention to
the prayers and responses. This caused some gossip
but the ocean waif was winning his way to favor by dint
of industry, a shrewd wit, and his perennial good humor.</p>

<p>Frequently they escorted fair Dorothy Stuart home
from church. She was fonder than ever of stalwart
Master Cockrell because the colonel had told her he
would have been a dead man had not the lad intervened
to save him from the stroke of a negro pirate. Alas,
however, it was not that sentimental devotion for which
the lovelorn Jack yearned, and he confided to Joe that
his existence was blighted. This evoked no sympathy
from the fickle Hawkridge, who was forgetting his
black-eyed lass in the Azores and was already a slave to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Dorothy Stuart. She laughed at them both and was
their true friend, tender, and whimsical and anxious for
their welfare. It was a valuable chapter in their education.</p>

<p>One morning while Joe was at work in the warehouse
near the harbor, he heard a commotion in the street and
was about to run out when his employer came in and
explained:</p>

<p>"Two pirates captured,&mdash;just as I happened to pass.
The knaves landed from a boat in broad daylight, unaware
that Charles Town has mended its loose habit toward
such gentry."</p>

<p>"What will be done with 'em?" quickly asked Joe,
with an unhappy premonition.</p>

<p>"They were recognized as two of Stede Bonnet's old
hands that used to resort to the tavern. Soldiers of the
Governor's guard have been sent for to drag them to the
gaol."</p>

<p>Joe hastened out but slackened his pace to lag behind
the crowd of idlers who were jostling the prisoners along
with hoots and jeers. Yes, there was the tall, gaunt
frame and gray head of old Trimble Rogers whose mien
was so forbidding and masterful that the mob forbore
to handle him too roughly, unarmed though he was. At
his elbow trudged chubby Bill Saxby, gazing about him
with those wide blue eyes in which was not a trace of
guile. Joe realized that for him to intercede would
make matters worse. He was a reformed pirate on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
probation and was known to have sailed with Blackbeard
himself.</p>

<p>Therefore he darted into another street and sped to
find Jack Cockrell, who chanced to be at home. They
rushed into the room where Uncle Peter Forbes was
writing at his desk and informed him that their two
staunch comrades had come ashore to find them and were
already in custody and something must be done to save
them from the wrath of Governor Johnson, who had a
mortal distaste for pirates still at large. The Councilor
calmed the perturbation by assuring them:</p>

<p>"I have already spoken to His Excellency in behalf
of these two men should they appear in this port. He
was not wholly pleased but promised clemency should
they offer to repent and if I gave surety for the pledge."</p>

<p>"They will be ready to live as respectable as Joe,"
impetuously declared Master Cockrell. "I'll go bail
on it. Bill Saxby is a tradesman by nature and if you
will lend him enough money to set himself up as a linen-draper
and haberdasher, Uncle Peter, he can live happily
ever after."</p>

<p>"And old Trimble Rogers has sailed his last cruise
under the Jolly Roger, Councilor," put in Joe Hawkridge.
"His timbers are full o' dry rot and he seeks a
safe mooring."</p>

<p>"There seems no end to the bad company you drag
me into," quoth Uncle Peter. "My hat and broadcloth
cloak, Jack, and let us fare to the gaol and see what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
these awkward visitors have to say. After that I will
attend upon the Governor."</p>

<p>In better spirits the anxious lads followed the dignified
Secretary of the Council to the strongly built gaol
on the edge of the town. In a very gloomy cell behind
iron bars they found the luckless brace of pirates, shackled
hand and foot. Bill Saxby took it like a placid
philosopher but the ancient buccaneer was spitting
Spanish oaths and condemning the hospitality of
Charles Town in violent terms. He quieted instantly
at sight of his young friends and the harsh, wrinkled
visage fairly beamed as he shouted:</p>

<p>"Our <i>camaradas</i>, Bill. Here they be, to haul us out
of this filthy hole! I forgive the unmannerly folks that
allus used to welcome us."</p>

<p>They shook hands through the bars while Uncle Peter
stood aside. He felt that his official station forbade his
joining this fraternal reunion. In the narrow corridor
he chatted with the gaoler to pass the time while Bill
Saxby was explaining to the lads:</p>

<p>"We was in duty bound, in a manner of speakin', to
run you down as soon as possible and make a report.
Eh, Trimble?"</p>

<p>"Aye, Bill, to see what was to be done about the treasure.
We wouldn't have 'em think we had run off with
it. D'ye see, Master Cockrell, me and Bill took Cap'n
Bonnet into our confidence. He is an honorable man
and to be mentioned along with the great Cap'n Ed'ard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Davis what I was shipmates with in the South Sea and
at the sack of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stow it, grandsire," cried Bill. "I don't want to
linger in gaol while you spin that long-winded yarn.
Tell the lads what they want to know."</p>

<p>"If I weren't chained to the wall, Bill, I'd put my fist
in your eye," severely retorted the veteran. "As I was
a-sayin', Cap'n Bonnet was all courtesy and allowed the
treasure belonged to us and he was ready to help find it."</p>

<p>"We told him we had to join up with our gentleman
partner, Master Cockrell, and win his consent," said
Bill, "afore we put our hooks on that blessed sea-chest."</p>

<p>"Which is exactly how I felt about you," Jack told
them and he was greatly touched by this proof of their
unbending fidelity. "But how did you manage it to
reach Charles Town?"</p>

<p>"Cap'n Bonnet hove to outside the bar last night,"
explained Trimble Rogers, "and gave us a handy boat
to sail in with."</p>

<p>The wary Joe Hawkridge took alarm at this and put
a finger to his lips. It was unwise to parade the fact
that Stede Bonnet cruised so near. His Excellency,
the Governor, was anxious that he should share the fate
of Blackbeard. Jack Cockrell had no fear that his
Uncle Peter would be a tale-bearer. His private honor
would forbid because this interview with the two lads
was a privileged communication. What made Jack a
trifle anxious was the presence of the gaol keeper in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
corridor. He was a sneaking sort of man, soft of tread
and oily of speech and inclined to curry favor with those
in authority.</p>

<p>Councilor Peter Forbes had tactfully withdrawn this
person beyond earshot but he began to edge toward the
cell. Old Trimble Rogers tried to heed Joe's cautionary
signal but what he meant to be a whisper was a hoarse
rumble as he explained:</p>

<p>"Cap'n Bonnet sends word he will be off this coast
again in thirty days. He will come ashore hisself, to
Sullivan's Island to get the answer, whether you are to
go with us, Master Cockrell, to Cherokee Inlet."</p>

<p>Jack glanced at the gaol keeper but he was a dozen
feet away and deep in talk with Mr. Forbes. There
was no sign that this confidence had been overheard.
Bill Saxby scolded the buccaneer for his careless speech
but the old man had been a freebooter too long to be
easily tamed. With artful design, Jack led him away
from this dangerous ground and suggested:</p>

<p>"You are done with pirating? And will you both be
ready to stay ashore in Charles Town after this,&mdash;this
certain errand is accomplished?"</p>

<p>"I swear it gladly and on my own Bible," answered
Trimble Rogers.</p>

<p>"Swear it for me," said Bill Saxby.</p>

<p>Mr. Forbes interrupted and told the lads to go home
and await his conference with Governor Johnson. It
proved to be a session somewhat stormy but the upshot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
was a pardon conditioned on good behavior. The convincing
argument was that these men had been faithful
to Master Cockrell through thick and thin and had saved
him from perishing in the Cherokee swamp. Moreover,
it might be an inducement to others of Stede Bonnet's
crew to surrender themselves and forsake their evil ways.</p>

<p>No sooner were these two pirates released from gaol
than they found an active friend in Mr. Peter Forbes.
He went about it quietly, for obvious reasons, but he
felt under great obligation to them for their goodness
to his nephew. Just at this time one of the shop-keepers
became a bankrupt because of unthrifty habits and
too much card-playing. Through an agent, Peter
Forbes purchased the stock of muslins and calicos, of
brocades and taffetas, calash bonnets, satin petticoats,
shoe-buckles, laces, and buttons. And having given his
promissory notes for said merchandise, Bill Saxby
proudly hung his own sign-board over the door.</p>

<p>There was a flutter among the ladies. Here was a
noteworthy sensation, to be served by an obsequious
pirate with innocent blue eyes who had sailed the Spanish
Main. A few days and it was evident that William
Saxby, late of London, would conduct a thriving trade.
He was fairly enraptured with his good fortune and
congenial occupation and took it most amiably when
Jack Cockrell or Joe Hawkridge sauntered in to tease
him. He was a disgrace to Stede Bonnet, said they, and
never had a pirate fallen to such a low estate as this.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Trimble Rogers was in no situation to rant at smug
William, the linen draper. The old sea wolf who had
outlived the most glorious era of the storied buccaneers,
had a few gold pieces tucked away in his belt and at
first he was content to loaf about the tavern, with an
audience to listen to his wondrous tales which ranged
from Henry Morgan to the great Captain Edward
Davis. But he had never been a sot or an idler and
soon he found himself lending a hand to assist the landlord
in this way or that. And when disorder occurred,
a word from this gray, hawk-eyed rover was enough to
quell the wildest roisterers from the plantations.</p>

<p>Children strayed to the tavern green to sit upon his
knee and twist those fierce mustachios of his, and their
mothers ceased to snatch them away when they learned
to know him better. Sometimes in his leisure hours he
pored over his tattered little Bible with muttering lips
and found pleasure in the Psalmist's denunciation of
his enemies who were undoubtedly Spaniards in some
other guise. He puttered about the flower beds with
spade and rake and kept the bowling green clipped
close with a keen sickle. In short, there was a niche for
Trimble Rogers in his old age and he seemed well satisfied
to fill it, just as Admiral Benbow spent his time
among his posies at Deptford when he was not bombarding
or blockading the French fleet off Dunkirk.</p>

<p>Jack Cockrell halted for a chat while passing the
tavern and these two shipmates retired to a quiet corner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
of the porch. The blind fiddler was plying a lively bow
and a dozen boys and girls danced on the turf. Trimble
Rogers surveyed them with a fatherly aspect as he said:</p>

<p>"They ain't afeard of me, Jack, not one of 'em. Was
ever a worn out old hulk laid up in a fairer berth?"</p>

<p>"None of the sea fever left, Trimble? What about
Captain Bonnet? He is due off the bar two days hence.
My uncle frowns upon my sailing with him to seek the
treasure. He insists that I steer clear of pirates."</p>

<p>"And that's entirely proper, Jack. I look at things
different like, now I be a worthy citizen. 'Tis better to
fit out a little expedition of our own, if we can drag
silly Bill out of his rubbishy shop."</p>

<p>"Oh, he will come fast enough after a while. We
are all tired of the sea just now," said Jack. "What
about Captain Bonnet and meeting him at Sullivan's
Island to pass the word that we must decline his courteous
invitation?"</p>

<p>"I shall tend to that," answered the retired buccaneer,
"And from what gossip I glean in the tavern,
Cap'n Bonnet had best steer for his home port of Barbadoes
and quit his fancy piratin'. This fractious
Governor has set his heart on hangin' him. And Colonel
Stuart is up and about again and has ordered the <i>King
George</i> to fit for sea. 'Tis rumored he has sent messages
to the north'ard for Lieutenant Maynard to sail
another cruise in his company."</p>

<p>"Then be sure you warn Stede Bonnet," strongly ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>vised
Jack. "I would not be disloyal to the Province
or to mine own good uncle, but one good turn deserves
another."</p>

<p>Two days after this, Trimble Rogers vanished from
the tavern and found Jack's canoe tied in a cove beyond
the settled part of the town. It was in the evening of
this same day that Jack was reading in his room by candle-light
when a tap-tap on the window shutter startled
him. He threw it open and dimly perceived that
Dorothy Stuart stood there. Her face was white in the
gloom and she wore a dress of some dark stuff. At her
beckoning gesture, Jack slipped through the window
and silently led her into the lane.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack, I have been so torn betwixt scruples,"
she softly confided. "And I hope I am not doing
wrong. If I am disloyal to my dear father, may I be
forgiven. But I have made myself believe that there is
a stronger obligation."</p>

<p>"It concerns Stede Bonnet," murmured Jack, reading
the motive of this secret errand.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are bound to befriend him, Jack, on your
honor as a gentleman."</p>

<p>"He has been warned to keep clear of Charles Town,
Dorothy. Trimble Rogers has gone off to meet him."</p>

<p>"But it is worse than that. The keeper of the gaol,
Jason Cutter, was closeted with my father this morning.
I heard something that was said. Soldiers have been
sent to Sullivan's Island."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"To capture Captain Bonnet?" wrathfully exclaimed
Jack. "Did Colonel Stuart go with them?
Does he know why Stede Bonnet risks putting into this
harbor in a small boat? It is to do a deed of pure friendship
and chivalry."</p>

<p>"All my father understands is what the gaoler reported,"
replied Dorothy, "and the Governor acted on
this evidence. No, he did not go with the troops but
sent a major in command."</p>

<p>"Too late for me to be of service, alas! If they take
Captain Bonnet alive, he will most certainly hang. And
Bill Saxby and Trimble Rogers will be embroiled in
some desperate attempt to aid his escape from gaol."</p>

<p>"I am a dreadful, wicked girl to be thus in league
with pirates," sighed Mistress Dorothy, "but I confess
to you, Jack dear, that it would grieve my heart to see
this charming pirate wear a hempen halter."</p>

<p>"My rival, is he? So I have found you out," flared
Jack, pretending vast indignation. "Nevertheless, I
shall still be true to him."</p>

<p>"And to me, I trust," she fondly replied. "Oh, I
feel so thankful that faithful Trimble Rogers is keeping
tryst. He will hear the soldiers blundering about in
time to make Captain Bonnet take heed and shove off."</p>

<p>Jack walked home with her, very glad of the excuse,
but with jealousy rankling in his bosom. It was not a
lasting malady, however, and he had forgotten it next
morning when he went early to the tavern to look for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Trimble Rogers. There he found the major of the detachment
at breakfast with an extraordinary story to
tell. He had made a landing on Sullivan's Island after
dark and deployed some of his men to patrol the beach
that faced the ocean. The squad which remained with
him had surprised a man lurking amongst the trees.
Pursued and fired at, he had led them an infernal chase
until they burst out upon the open beach. There they
heard the sound of oars and voices in a boat which was
making in for the shore. The hunted man raised his
voice in one stentorian shout of:</p>

<p>"Pull out to sea, Cap'n Bonnet. And 'ware this
coast. The soldiers are on my heels. Old Trimble
Rogers sends a fare-ye-well."</p>

<p>The boat was wrenched about in a trice and moved
away from the island, soon disappearing in the direction
of the bar. The major's men had shot at it but without
effect. When they had rushed to capture the fugitive
who had shouted the warning, they found him prone
upon the sand. There was not a scratch on him and yet
he was quite dead. The prodigious exertion had broken
his heart, ventured the major, and it had ceased to beat.
His body would be prepared for Christian burial because
of the esteem in which he was already held by
many of the townspeople.</p>

<p>To Jack Cockrell and Joe Hawkridge it was sad
news indeed but tender-hearted Bill Saxby mourned
like one who had lost a parent. He closed the shop for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
a day and hung black ribbons on the knob. They agreed
that the end had come for Trimble Rogers as he would
have wished it, giving his life in loyal service to a friend
and master. And perhaps it was better thus than for
the creeping disabilities of old age to overtake him.</p>

<p>"He knew he was liable to pop off," said Bill, "with
the rheumatism getting closer to his heart all the time.
And he told me, did Trimble, that his share of the treasure
was to go to the poor and needy of the town. Orphans
and such was Trimble's weakness."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>THE QUEST FOR PIRATES' GOLD</h3>


<div class='unindent'><big>A</big> SMALL sloop was making its leisurely way up
the Carolina coast with a crew of a dozen men
all told. The skipper was Captain Jonathan
Wellsby who was taking this holiday cruise before sailing
for England to command a fine new ship in the
colonial trade. In the cabin were Jack Cockrell and
Joe Hawkridge, Councilor Peter Arbuthnot Forbes,
and that brisk young linen draper William Saxby. In
the forecastle were trusty seamen who had sailed in the
<i>Plymouth Adventure</i>. The sloop's destination was
Cherokee Inlet and she was equipped with tackle and
gear for a peculiar kind of fishing.</div>

<p>For once they made a voyage without fear of pirates.
Safely the sloop passed in by the outlying cay where
the charred bones of Blackbeard's brig were washed by
the surf. An anchorage was found in the bight where
the <i>Revenge</i> had tarried, close by the beach and the
greensward of the pirates' old camp. After diligent
preparation all hands manned a boat which pulled into
the mouth of the sluggish creek. With axes to clear the
entanglements and men enough to shove over the muddy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
shoals the boat was slowly forced up-stream and then
into the smaller creek at the fork of the waters.</p>

<p>Uncle Peter Forbes was as gay as a truant schoolboy.
This was the lark of a lifetime. The two lads,
however, were uneasy and depressed. To them this
sombre region was haunted, if not by ghosts then by
memories as unhappy. They would not have been surprised
to see Blackbeard skulking in the tall grass, his
head bound in red calico, his pistols cocked to ambush
them. And, alas, old Trimble Rogers was not along to
protect them with his musket. He had lived and
dreamed in expectation of this quest.</p>

<p>"We'll find no treasure, nary a penny of it," dolefully
observed Joe Hawkridge who had actually begun
to shiver.</p>

<p>"Of course we can find the sea-chest, you ninny,"
scolded Jack.</p>

<p>"Dead or alive, Cap'n Ed'ard Teach flew away with
it afore now," was Joe's rejoinder. "He was a master
one at black magic."</p>

<p>"Don't chatter like an idiot," spoke up Uncle Peter
who was wildly brushing the mosquitoes from a sun-blistered
nose. "My faith, I cannot understand how
you lads got out of this swamp alive. It breeds all the
plagues of Egypt."</p>

<p>They came to the tiny lagoon and rounded the bend
beyond which the pirogue had capsized Blackbeard's
cock-boat. There was nothing to indicate that any hu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>man
being had visited this lonely spot since that sensational
encounter. No trees had been cut down to serve
as purchases for lifting the sea-chest from its oozy hiding-place.
It was agreed that some traces would have
remained if Blackbeard had been at work here before
his death.</p>

<p>A camp was made upon the higher ground of the
knoll and the party went about its task with skill and
deliberation. Jointed sounding rods of iron were
screwed together and the exact position of the spot determined
from Jack Cockrell's chart and description.
But neither he nor Joe Hawkridge could be coaxed into
lending more active assistance. They were afraid of
disturbing the bones of the drowned seaman who had
fled from Blackbeard's bloody dirk. Jack had seen him
go down and it was not a pleasant recollection. And
so these two heroes who had faced so many other perils
without flinching were content to putter about half-heartedly
and let the others exert themselves.</p>

<p>All one day they prodded and sounded but struck
only sunken logs. What gave them more concern than
this was the discovery that the slender rods, sharpened
to a point, could be driven through one yielding stratum
after another of muck and ooze. Through myriad years
the decaying vegetable matter of this rank swamp had
been accumulating in these layers of muck. There was
no telling how deep down the weight of the sea-chest
might have caused it to settle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Peter Forbes began to lose his youthful optimism
and took four men to go and dig in the knoll while the
others continued to search for the chest. The wooden
cross still stood above the grave of Jesse Strawn and
the long-leaf pines murmured his requiem. Having selected
at random a place where he thought treasure
ought to be, the worthy Councilor wielded a shovel until
he perspired rivers.</p>

<p>"Confound it, Blackbeard must have left a scrap of
paper somewhere to give us the proper instructions,"
he complained. "'Tis the custom of all proper pirates.
Look at the trouble he has put us to."</p>

<p>"I helped search the cabin afore the brig was set
afire," replied one of the seamen, "and all the writin'
we found was in the bit of a book with the leaves tore
out, same as Cap'n Wellsby made a fair copy of."</p>

<p>"That explains it," cried Uncle Peter. "I have no
doubt the vile Blackbeard destroyed his private note
of where he hid it, just to make the matter more difficult
for us honest men."</p>

<p>This was plausible, but it failed to solve the riddle.
A day or two of impatient digging and the portly Secretary
of the Council was almost wrecked in mind and
body, what with insects and heat, ague and fatigue.
The ardor of his companions had likewise slackened.
The boat's crew swore that the condemned sea-chest
must have sunk all the way to China. Joe Hawkridge
still argued that Blackbeard had whisked it away in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
cloud of smoke and brimstone. The unhappy Mr. Peter
Forbes suggested:</p>

<p>"What say you, lads, to dropping down to the sloop
for a respite from this accursed swamp? There we can
take comfort and discuss what is to be done next."</p>

<p>Captain Jonathan Wellsby, who was a stubborn man,
urged that they fish once more for the sunken chest before
taking a rest, and this was agreed to. The sounding
rods were plied with vigor and, at length, one of
them drove against some solid object deep in the mud.
It was more unyielding than a water-soaked log. The
iron rod was lifted and rammed down with a thud which
was like metal striking against metal. The explorers
forgot the torments of the swamp. Uncle Peter
Forbes was in no haste to flee the mosquitoes and the
fever.</p>

<p>The sailors began to rig the spars and tackle as a
derrick set up on the bank of the creek, with grapple
hooks like huge tongs to swing out over the water and
grope in the muddy depths. Absorbed in this fascinating
task, they were startled beyond measure to hear
the <i>thump, thump</i> of thole-pins sounding from somewhere
below them in the swamp. It was no Indian
pirogue. Only a ship's boat heavily manned could make
that cadenced noise of oars. Bill Saxby bade the men
be silent while he held a hand at his ear and harkened
with taut attention. The mysterious boat, following the
winding channel of the creek, was drawing nearer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Voices could be heard, a rough command, a curse, a
laugh.</p>

<p>"No honest men, I warrant," growled Captain Jonathan
Wellsby, ready to take command by virtue of long
habit. "Who else can they be but pirates, plague 'em.
And they are betwixt us and the sea. All hands ashore
and look to your arms. Lively now."</p>

<p>They were bewildered and taken all aback. In this
holiday excursion after Blackbeard's treasure the party
had reckoned only with dead or phantom pirates.
There was some confusion, while Bill Saxby bawled at
the seamen as addle-pated lubbers. Deserting their
boat, they scrambled to cover in the tall grass while
those busy with the derrick gear rushed to catch up
muskets and powder-horns.</p>

<p>The strange boat was steadily forging up-stream and
presently it was disclosed to view no more than a cable-length
away. It was a pinnace filled with ruffianly fellows,
more than a score of them. No merchant seamen
these but brethren of the coast, freebooters who were
gallows-ripe. Bill Saxby was quick to recognize two or
three of them as old hands of Blackbeard's crew who
must have deserted their leader in time to escape his
fate. Presumably they had recruited others of their
own stamp to go adventuring in the Cherokee swamp.
They could have only one purpose. The very sight of
them was enough to explain it. They were in quest of
treasure like bloodhounds trailing a scent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>Against such a force as this, discretion was the better
part of valor. A ferocious yell burst from the pinnace
and a flight of musket balls whistled over the heads of
the fugitives who had so hastily abandoned their operations
with the derrick and gear and the boat. Stout Bill
Saxby and his comrades, finding concealment in the
swamp, primed their muskets and let fly a volley at the
pinnace which was an easy target. A pirate standing
in the stern-sheets clapped a hand to his thigh and sat
down abruptly. Another one let go his oar to dangle
a bloody hand.</p>

<p>The pinnace drifted with the tide and stranded on a
weedy shoal while the blue powder smoke hung over it
like a fog. For the moment it was a demoralized crew
of pirates, roaring all manner of threats but at a loss
how to proceed. The other party took advantage of this
delay to beat a rapid retreat along the path which led
to the knoll where the camp was pitched. Upon this
higher ground they might hope to defend themselves
against a force which outnumbered them. They ran at
top speed, bending low, hidden from observation, avoiding
the pools and bogs.</p>

<p>The pirates were diverted from their hostile intentions
as soon as they caught sight of the tall spars and
tackle, and the boat with its sounding rods and other
gear. With a great clamor they swarmed out of the
pinnace and began to investigate. This gave the refugees
on the knoll a little time to make their camp more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
compact, to wield the shovels furiously and throw up
intrenchments, to cut down trees for a barricade, to fill
the water kegs, to prepare to withstand an assault or a
siege.</p>

<p>The sun went down and the infatuated pirates were
still exploring the creek, convinced that they could
straightway lay hold of the treasure they had come to
find. They kindled a fire on the bank and evidently
intended to pass the night there. This mightily eased
the minds of the toilers upon the knoll. Their predicament
was still awkward in the extreme but the fear of
sudden death had been lifted. And it seemed possible
that these bothersome pirates might conclude to leave
them alone.</p>

<p>It went sorely against the grain, however, to be driven
away from the precious sea-chest when it was almost
within their grasp, to have to scuttle from this crew of
scurvy pirates. Jack Cockrell was for making a sortie
by night, gustily declaiming to his companions:</p>

<p>"The sentries will be drunk or drowsy. I know these
swine. A well-timed rush and we can cut 'em down and
pistol the rest. Didn't they open fire on us from the
pinnace?"</p>

<p>"Aye, Jack, and we'll fight to save our skins," said
the cool-headed Captain Wellsby, "but 'tis a desperate
business to attack yon cut-throats, even by night, and
there will be men of us hurt and killed. Blackbeard's
gold is not worth it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>"Right sensibly put," declared Mr. Peter Forbes.
"We had best spend this night in felling more trees and
notching logs to pile them breast high. If these pirates
find the sea-chest, they will leave us unmolested. If
they fail to find it, they may conclude that we have already
discovered the treasure. In that event, they will
storm the knoll and give us no quarter."</p>

<p>"It would be rank folly to surrender," said stout Bill
Saxby. "There be men in the pinnace who have no
love for me nor for the two lads. 'Twas a shrewd suspicion
of theirs that Blackbeard had played secret tricks
in this Cherokee swamp, what with his excursions in
that little cock-boat."</p>

<p>Keeping vigilant watch, they labored far into the
night until the camp on the knoll was a hard nut to
crack, with its surrounding ditch and palisade of logs
behind which a man could lie and shoot. Now and then
it might have been noted that Jack Cockrell and Joe
Hawkridge conferred with their heads together as
though something private were in the wind. As soon as
they were relieved from duty, some time before the
dawn, they stole very softly away from the knoll and
groped along the path which led to the creek. Curiosity
and the impetuous folly of youth impelled them to reconnoitre
the pirates' bivouac.</p>

<p>"We may hear something worth listening to," whispered
Jack, "and perhaps we can crawl close and steal
some of their arms."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>"None of that," chided young Hawkridge. "I am
a man of goodly station in Charles Town and I would
go back with a whole hide."</p>

<p>"You have grown too respectable," grumbled Jack.
"Here is the chance for one last fling&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His words stuck in his throat. A gurgle of horrified
amazement and he tumbled headlong into the grass with
a bare, sinewy arm wrapped around his neck. He
fought to free himself but the breath was fairly choked
out of him. Joe Hawkridge was desperately thrashing
about in the swamp, gasping and snorting, his cries also
smothered. In a twinkling they were captives, their
arms tightly bound behind them, the stifling grip of
their necks unrelaxed. Weakened almost to suffocation,
the two lads could make no lively resistance. Jack
uttered one feeble shout for help but subsided when
those strong fingers tightened the clutch on his windpipe.</p>

<p>The assailants made no sound. Not a word was uttered.
There were several of them, for the helpless
prisoners were picked up bodily and lugged along by
the head and the heels. They expected to be taken into
the pirates' camp, believing they had been surprised and
overpowered by an outlying sentry post. It was an old
game, reflected Joe Hawkridge, to hold them alive as
hostages. But he was vastly puzzled when these silent
kidnappers, deftly picking their way in the darkness,
took a direction which led them away from the bank of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
the creek. They had forsaken the trampled path and
were proceeding through the trackless swamp whose pitfalls
were avoided by a sort of sixth sense.</p>

<p>A mile of this laborious, uncanny progress and the
bearers dumped their burdens and paused to rest. The
two lads dizzily crawled to their feet and peered at the
shadowy figures surrounding them. They heard a guttural
exclamation and words exchanged in a strange,
harsh tongue.</p>

<p>"Indians, blow me!" hoarsely whispered Joe, his
throat sore and swollen.</p>

<p>"Comrade ahoy!" croaked Jack. "No pirates these,
but Yemassees. Do they save us for the torture?"</p>

<p>"God knows. 'Tis a sorry mischance as ever was.
I'd sooner meet up with Blackbeard's ghost. Are ye
badly hurt?"</p>

<p>"Like a man hanged by the neck, Joe, but no mortal
wounds. Had we minded Uncle Peter we would be safe
in the sloop by now. One more day of hunting that
filthy treasure undid us."</p>

<p>The half dozen Yemassees squatted about them, talking
in low tones, and offered no further violence. Presumably
they were waiting for daybreak, having conveyed
their prisoners beyond all chance of rescue. The
two lads shivered with fear and weariness. They were
bruised and breathless and the thongs which tightly
bound their wrists made their arms ache intolerably.
Bitter was the regret at invading this baleful Cherokee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
swamp when they might have remained safe from all
harm in pleasant Charles Town.</p>

<p>Sadly they watched the eastern sky grow brighter
while the gloom of the desolate swamp turned wan and
gray. The Indian captors became visible, brown, half-naked
men wearing leggings and breech-clouts of tanned
deerskin. Two of them carried muskets. They were
not made hideous by war-paint, as Jack Cockrell was
quick to note. He said to his companion:</p>

<p>"A hunting party, Joe. They were spying on our
camp, like enough, or keeping watch of the pirates. No
doubt they wonder why white men come to fight one
another in the swamp."</p>

<p>"They will wish to find out from us," was the hopeful
reply. "They seem a deal more curious than bloodthirsty.
A stout heart, say I, and we may weather it
yet."</p>

<p>Soon the lads were roughly prodded ahead and went
stumbling and splashing through the marshy verdure
and slippery ooze until they came to higher ground and
easier walking. Upon this ridge they descried the camp
of the Yemassees&mdash;huts fashioned of poles and bark and
boughs, a freshly killed deer hanging from a tree, smoke
rising from beneath a huge iron kettle, plump, naked
children scampering in play with several barking dogs,
the squaws shrilly scolding them. Several warriors lazily
emerged from the huts, yawning, brushing the long
black hair from their eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>They moved more actively at perceiving the procession
which approached from the swamp. Two or three
ran back to the largest shelter and presently a big-bodied,
middle-aged man strode out, his mien stern and
dignified, his rank denoted by the elaborate fringed
tunic of buckskin and the head-dress of heron plumes.
He shouted something in a sonorous voice. The hunting
party hastened forward, dragging the two English
lads by the elbows and flinging them down at the feet
of the chief. He stood with arms folded across his chest,
scowling, formidable.</p>

<p>Then he spoke a few words of broken English, to the
astonishment of the captives. He mentioned the names
of settlements on the Cape Fear River where, it was inferred,
he had been on friendly terms with the colonists.
His manner was not so much hostile as questioning. In
Charles Town both Joe and Jack had learned the common
phrases of the Indian tongue such as were used
among the merchants and traders. Pieced out with
signs and gestures, they were able to carry on a halting
dialogue with the chief of this small band.</p>

<p>They were able to comprehend that he hated pirates
above all other men. He recognized the name of Blackbeard
and indicated his great joy that this eminent
scoundrel had met his just deserts. Many times the
freebooters of the coast had hunted and slain the Indians
for wanton sport. And perhaps the word had sped of
that expedition of Captain Stede Bonnet out of Charles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Town when he had exterminated the Yemassees who
had set out to harry and burn the near-by plantations.
The two uneasy lads felt that they still stood in the
shadow of death unless they could persuade the chief
that they were not pirates, that they were in no way to
be confused with the crew of blackguards which had
ascended the creek in the pinnace.</p>

<p>The chief delayed his judgment. Two young men
lifted the huge kettle from the fire. It was steaming
with a savory smell of stewed meat. The captives were
invited to join the others in spearing bits of venison
with sharpened sticks. Chewing lustily, with a noble
appetite, Joe Hawkridge confided:</p>

<p>"My spirits rise, Jack. An empty belly always did
make a coward of me. How now, my lusty cockerel?
Shall we flap our wings and crow?"</p>

<p>"Crow we must, or have our necks wrung as pirates,"
said Jack, gnawing a bone. "Which one of us shall
make the first oration?"</p>

<p>"The nephew of the Councilor, of course," cried Joe,
"with his cargo of Greek and Latin education. Make
a power of noise, Jack."</p>

<p>And now indeed did young Master Cockrell prove
that all those drudging hours with snuffy Parson
Throckmorton had not been wasted. Standing in an
open space, clear of the crowd, he addressed the chief
in loud and impressive language. The gist of it was
that he and his friends were the sworn foes of all pirates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
and especially anxious to rid the world of such vermin
as those that had come into the Cherokee swamp in the
great ship's boat and were encamped on the bank of the
creek.</p>

<p>This other peaceful party entrenched on the knoll
were honest, law-abiding men of Charles Town who
would harm no one. They had come in search of pirates'
gold. If the chief of the Yemassees would join
forces with them and smoke the pipe of peace, they
would drive those foul pirates out of the Cherokee
swamp. And should the gold be found, it would be
fairly divided between the godly men of Charles Town
and their Indian allies. To bind this bargain Master
Cockrell and Master Hawkridge were ready to pledge
their honor and their lives.</p>

<p>It was a most eloquent effort delivered with much
gesticulation. The Yemassee braves set in a circle and
grunted approval. They liked the sound and fury of it.
Jack hurled scraps of Homer and Virgil at them when
at a loss for resounding periods. The chief nodded his
understanding of such words as <i>pirates</i> and <i>gold</i> and
actually smiled when Jack's pantomime depicted the
death of Blackbeard on the deck of his ship. <i>Gold</i> was
a magic word to these Indians. It would purchase
muskets and powder and ball, cloth and ironmongery
and strong liquors from the white men of the settlements.</p>

<p>The chief discussed it with his followers. During<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
the lull Joe Hawkridge said, with a long sigh of relief:</p>

<p>"My scalp itches not so much, Jack. The notion of
having it twisted off with a dull blade vexed me. Ye
did wondrous well. The mouth of Secretary Peter
Forbes would ha' gaped wide open."</p>

<p>"Much sound and little sense, Joe, but methinks it
hit the target. I took care to sprinkle it with such words
as yonder savage could bite on."</p>

<p>"If we find no gold, the fat may be in the fire again,
but it gives us time to draw breath."</p>

<p>They rubbed their chafed wrists and sat on the ground
while the savages held a long pow-wow. The chief was
explaining the purport of Master Cockrell's impressive
declamation. There was no enmity in the glances aimed
at the English lads. It was more a matter of deliberation,
of passing judgment on the truth or the falsity of
the story. It was plain to read that the Yemassees desired
to lay greedy hold of Blackbeard's gold. They
were like children listening to a fairy tale. The fat little
papooses crawled timidly near to inspect the mysterious
strangers and scrambled away squealing with delicious
terror.</p>

<p>The hours passed and the verdict was delayed. Two
young braves stole away into the pine woodland on
some errand, at the behest of the chief. It was after
noon when they returned. With them came a dozen
Yemassee warriors from another hunting camp, strong,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
quick-footed men in light marching order who were
armed with long bows and knives. The chief spoke a
few words and mustered his force. All told he had more
than thirty picked followers. The English lads were
told to move with them.</p>

<p>In single file the band flitted silently along the ridge
and plunged into the swamp. The prisoners were
closely guarded. At the slightest sign of treachery the
long knives would slither between their ribs. This they
well knew and their devout prayer was that their friends
on the knoll might not commit some rash act of hostility
and so ruin the enterprise. With heart-quaking trepidation
they perceived at some distance the rude barricade
of logs and the yellow streaks of earth hastily
thrown up.</p>

<p>The cautious Yemassees concealed themselves as
though the swamp had swallowed them up. The chief
made certain signs, and the lads understood his meaning.
Jack Cockrell ripped a sleeve from his shirt and
tied it to a stick as a flag of truce. Joe Hawkridge advanced
with them, the stalwart chief between them, his
empty hands extended in token of peace. The ambushed
Yemassees, lying in the tall grass, were ready to
let fly with musket balls and flights of arrows or to
storm the knoll.</p>

<p>A sailor on sentry duty gave the alarm and the lads
saw a row of heads bob above the logs, and the gleam
of weapons. Then Captain Jonathan Wellsby moved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
out into the open and was joined by Mr. Peter Forbes.
They stood gazing at the singular spectacle, the bedraggled
runaways who had vanished without trace, the
odd flag of truce, the brawny, dignified savage making
signs of friendship. The men in the stockade were ordered
to lay down their arms. They came running out
to cheer and wave their hats.</p>

<p>Mr. Peter Forbes was torn betwixt affection and the
desire to scold his flighty nephew. They met half-way
down the slope and Jack hastened to explain:</p>

<p>"Before you clap us in irons as deserters, Uncle
Peter, grant a parley, if you please. Our lives hang by
a hair."</p>

<p>"God bless me, boy, we thought the pirates had slain
you both," spluttered Uncle Peter, a tear in his eye.
"What means this tall savage?"</p>

<p>"A noble chief of the Yemassees who used us with
all courtesy," said Jack.</p>

<p>Captain Wellsby had drawn Joe Hawkridge aside
and was swiftly enlightened concerning the alliance with
the Indians. Presently they were holding a conference,
all seated together in the shade of a tree. A tobacco
pipe of clay, with a long reed for a stem, was lighted
and passed from hand to hand. The chief puffed solemnly
with an occasional nod and a grunt. It was
agreed, with due ceremony, that the pirates should be
attacked in their camp and driven away. The Yemassee
warriors would make common cause with the English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>men.
As a reward, Blackbeard's treasure was to be
fairly divided, half and half.</p>

<p>The chief raised his voice in a long, deep shout of
summons and his band of fighting men emerged from
their ambush in the swamp. There was no reason for
delaying the movement against the pirates. The <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Yemasses'">Yemassees</ins>
were eager for the fray. They were about to
advance through the swamp, cunningly hidden, while
the Englishmen followed at a slower pace to spread out
on the flanks. Just then there was heard a sudden and
riotous commotion among the pirates at the creek. It
was a mad, jubilant uproar as though some frenzy had
seized them all. Bill Saxby leaned on his musket and
listened for a long moment.</p>

<p>"The rogues have fished up the sea-chest, by the din
they make," said he. "We left that sounding rod
a-stickin' in the mud. They save us the trouble, eh,
Captain Wellsby?"</p>

<p>The skipper laughed in his beard and floundered
ahead like a bear. Jack Cockrell passed the word to
the chief that the gold was awaiting them. Like
shadows the Yemassees drew near the creek and then,
full-lunged, terrific, their war-whoop echoed through
the dismal Cherokee swamp. Nimble Jack Cockrell
was not far behind them, his heart pumping as though
it would burst.</p>

<p>He was in time to see four lusty pirates swaying at a
rope which led through the pulley-blocks of the spars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
that overhung the creek as a tall derrick. They were
hoisting away with all their might while there slowly
rose in air a mud-covered, befouled sea-chest all hung
with weeds and slimy refuse. Two other pirates tailed
on to a guy rope and the heavy chest swung toward the
bank, suspended in air.</p>

<p>At this moment the screeching chorus of the Indian
war-whoop smote their affrighted ears, followed by the
discharge of muskets. These startled pirates let go the
tackle and the guy rope and, with one accord, leaped
for the pinnace which floated close to the bank. The
weighty sea-chest swinging in air came down by the run
as the ropes smoked through the blocks. It had been
swayed in far enough so that it fell not in the water but
upon the edge of the shore between the derrick spars.
The rusty hinges and straps were burst asunder as the
treasure chest crashed upon a log and cracked open like
an egg.</p>

<p>Out spilled a stream of doubloons and pieces of eight,
a cascade of gold and silver bars, of jewels flowing from
the rotten bags which had contained them. In this extraordinary
manner was the hoard of the departed
Blackbeard brought to light. The unfortunate pirates
who had found the spoils tarried not to gloat and rejoice.
They appeared to have urgent business elsewhere.
In hot pursuit came the ravening Yemassees,
yelling like fiends, assisted by the reinforcements of
Captain Jonathan Wellsby.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>What saved the lives of these panic-smitten pirates
was the dramatic explosion of that great treasure chest
when it fell and smashed upon the log. Indians and
Englishmen alike forgot their intent to shoot and
slaughter. They rushed to surround the bewitching
booty, to cut capers like excited urchins.</p>

<p>"Share and share," roared Captain Wellsby, shoving
them headlong. "Half to the Yemassees and half to
us. Our word is given. Stand back, ye lunatics, while
we do the thing with order and decency."</p>

<p>Already the pinnace was filled with cursing pirates
who saw that the game was lost. Some of them had left
their weapons in camp, others fired a few wild shots, but
those who had any wit left were tugging at the oars to
make for the open sea.</p>

<p>"After 'em," roared Bill Saxby. "Follow down the
creek to make sure they do not molest our sloop."</p>

<p>A score of men, Indians included, jumped into the
boat and pulled in chase, no longer on slaughter bent.
The only thought in their heads was to despatch the
errand and return to squat around the treasure chest.
Jack Cockrell and Joe Hawkridge remained to help
scoop up the coin and jewels and stow them in stout
kegs and sacks. The stoical chief of the Yemassees was
grinning from ear to ear as he grunted:</p>

<p>"<i>Plenty gold. Good! Hurrah, boys!</i>"</p>

<p>Arm-in-arm Jack Cockrell and Joe Hawkridge
danced a sailor's hornpipe upon the splintered lid of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Blackbeard's sea-chest while they sang with all their
might:</p>
